The authors develop a model which makes it possible to pass through a first-order phase transition from one type of condensation to the other; at the critical point they note coexistence of both states. This type of model can give insight into some effects which have been observed in helium and which may depend on the presence of both types of condensation.@@@Alcuni

In the 4-h exposure the concentrations were approximately 220 and 440 ppm, and in the 3-month study (5×8 h/week) approximately 204 ppm (MAC= 200 ppm).

The behavior of methylchloroform and its metabolites (trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid) in the expired air, blood, and urine was investigated. A gaschromatographic method for the determination of methylchloroform is described. Most of the methylchloroform is eliminated unchanged via the lungs.

In the subchronic inhalation studies, methylchloroform concentrations within the range of the MAC were tolerated with no symptoms. During this time, the concentrations of methylchloroform and trichloroethanol in the blood and the concentration of trichloroacetic acid in the urine remained constant. The urinary trichloroethanol excretion increased until the 10th week, then it fell and remained constant at a level somewhat below the maximum concentration.

Using the horseradish peroxidase method, it was shown under the electron microscope that the endothelial barrier of the iris vessels broke down. The peroxidase penetrated as far as the basis of the posterior epithelial cells, however, without entering their lateral intercellular spaces. The question of whether the effect of prostaglandins on the barrier was a direct effect or at least a partially indirect one, i.e., a haemodynamic action, is discussed.@@@Public Health

The light and medium volatility fraction (L+M) appeared directly proportional to the metal content. In contrast, the heavy fraction (H) (350–550°) was inversely proportional to the metal content. This contradiction was attributed to the autocatalytic degradation of some of the heavy fraction into lighter species, which upgrades the crude with respect to the (L+M) fraction at the expense of the heavy fraction. The crudes were identical with regard to the ratio (L+M) to (H+R), whereR=residue, as a consequence of their identical API gravity and sulphur contents.

The rate of degradative volatilization of the heavy fraction was measured by DTG, which indicated a direct correlation with the vanadium content as regards the onset temperatures and the DTG peak maximum.@@@Vanadium

Generally, the retention times depend both on the number of methylene groups (n) between the two sulphur atoms and on the alkyl groups R1 and R2. Substitution of n-alkyl groups R by e.g.,i-propyl ort-butyl leads to a decrease in the retention times. This can be explained by the weaker attachement of bulky alkyl groups to the ODS phase (HPLC) and lower boiling points (GC), respectively. A linear correlation was found between boiling points and retention data (Kovats indices) in GC. In HPLC the retention increments of the methylene groups — (CH2)n — between the two sulphur atoms are lower in the case ofn=2–4 than forn>4, which can be related to a sulphur-sulphur interaction.@@@HPLC

Research was made into chemical and spectral interferences which can arise in all three methods. The 249.678 nm boron emission line is not affected by the sample matrix indicated. The boron content from more than 60 extracts was determined using the three methods mentioned and the results were compared by means of regression calculations. It was found that ICP-AES and the dianthrimide procedure do not differ significantly, whereas the azomethin-H technique leads to somewhat higher values. The accuracy of the results achieved by means of ICP-AES was confirmed by a collaborative study. In order to determine the concentration of boron in soils in the range of 0–2 mg/kg the ICP-AES can be applied following the hot water extraction without further pretreatment of samples. This method is superior in particular when additional elements are to be considered in the soil.@@@"

Noble metals (Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Rh) under reducing conditions were studied as matrix modifiers for the determination of Sn by GFAAS. The maximum ashing temperature (1400°C), highest sensitivity and the best absolute detection limit (4 pg) were achieved when Pd was used in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The achievable sensitivity depended strongly on the chemical composition of the matrix.

Both GFAAS and ICP-MS appeared to be equally sensitive techniques for the direct determination of Sn in waters, though ICP-MS was a more convenient and sensitive technique for the determination of Sn in digested biological and geological materials.@@@Graphite

It has been shown on the basis of comparative tests, in which laboratories in Europe, Japan and USA have participated, that with regard to power of detection as well as reproducibility even at levels below 500 ng/g neutron activation analysis (INAA, RNAA), wet chemical multistep procedures and GDMS can contribute to the characterization of high-purity aluminium. The measurement of the resistivity ratio have proved as a suitable test for the integral content of dissolved impurities. H at levels of 0.3 μg/g can be measured by vacuum solid extraction or carrier gas fusion. For a complete and optimal characterization of high-purity aluminium all these methods are needed and should periodically be checked against each other.@@@Aluminium

Single edge-notched specimens were fractured in the four-point bend configuration under cyclic and quasi-static tensile loads. At a load ratio of 0.1, the threshold stress intensity factor range, ΔK, for fracture initiation in cyclic tension is as low as 3.4 M Pam1/2, and catastrophic failure occurs at ΔK=6.6 M Pam1/2. For crack length less than 1 mm and for plane strain conditions, growth rates are highly discontinuous, and periodic crack arrest is observed after growth over distances of the order of tens of micrometres. Crack advance could only be resumed with an increase in the far-field stress intensity range. The mechanisms of short crack advance in cyclic tension are similar to those observed under quasi-static loads, and the tensile fatigue effect appears to be a manifestation of “static failure modes”. A model is presented to provide an overall framework for the tensile fatigue crack growth characteristics of partially stabilized zirconia. Experimental results are also described to demonstrate the possibility of stable room temperature crack growth under cyclic tension in fine-grained tetragonal zirconia polycrystals, partially stabilized with Y2O3. The growth of cracks in transformation-toughened ceramics is found to be strongly influenced by the crack size and shape, stress state and specimen geometry.@@@Fatigue Crack

In the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system, there are two superconducting phases corresponding to transition temperatures of 110 and 80 K, respectively.

The wafers are p type (resistivityρ ⊥=160 Ωcm, the grains are columnar shape with some orientation). An average potential barrier of 0.087 eV appears to exist across the grain boundary between columns. Ohmic back contacts were made from a Ga-Al alloy. Diodes were investigated with the aid of (a)I-V characteristics at different temperatures, (b)C-V characteristics, (c) spectral response and (d) Fowler's plot of photoelectric measurements. The best diodes had characteristics similar to data typical of monocrystalline silicon. The low series columnar resistance (0.67Ω) of the cells is neglected in the analysis. The barrier height, fromI-V data (including temperature variation) was 0.67 to 0.73 eV. This is much lower than that obtained from Fowler's plot (0.9 eV). However, the barrier height obtained from theC-V graph is in agreement with the value of 0.9 eV. The diffusion potential is 0.4 eV. The value of the diode ideality factor (1.5 to 2.8) indicates that recombination generation processes play a dominant role. The normalized photovoltaic spectral response in the wavelength range 600 to 1300 nm was presented with a comparison from the theory taking into account bulk and surface recombination.@@@Barrier Height

Selected polysilazanes bearing different substituents at silicon and nitrogen were synthesized by ruthenium catalysed dehydrocoupling of Si-H bonds with N-H bonds. The relationships between the structure and chemical content of polymers and their pyrolysed ceramic compositions and yields are discussed. Possible reactions occurring during pyrolysis are described in terms of a set of mechanisms based on known behaviour of silazane monomers. The decomposition product patterns at different temperature levels and the compositions of the final ceramics suggest specific kinetically or thermodynamically controlled thermolysis pathways. Additional chemical reactivity has been observed when the amorphous ceramic products at 800° C are heated and crystallized at 1600° C.@@@Pyrolysis

However, our numerical computations indicate that the polar plot of the mean intercept length at the angle of measurement may become nearly ellipsoidal as the microstructure (fibres or plates) become less discretely organized, but yet remain orthotropic. The equations presented in this study may be used to obtain fibre (plate) orientation density functions from the experimental data on mean intercept length distribution.@@@Polymer

Nitrogen can modify superficially the steel's chemistry and/or microstructure depending on the fluence and thereby affect the processes of hydrogen diffusion and trapping. The implantations were performed on low carbon steel specimens with different nominal doses (1% to 10% and 33% nitrogen in a superficial layer of approximately 100 to 120 nm). The corresponding microstructures were characterized and permeation tests were conducted at room temperature in a double electrolytic cell. The nitrogen implanted layers on iron affects the electrochemical behaviour of the surface and the permeation in the material. This effect depends on the nitrogen concentration in the layer and on the corresponding microstructure. A continuous Fe2N layer acts as an efficient barrier to hydrogen entry and permeation when the layer is located on the entry face of the permeation membrane. This effect is stronger when the implanted layer is on the downstream face of the membrane. The low permeability values are mainly attributed to a lower hydrogen solubility in the implanted layer, whereas hydrogen trapping on defects and nitride precipitates delay hydrogen penetration.@@@Carbon Steel

Distinct composition dependency of Mössbauer parameters (Δ and Γ) of Fe3+ ions, having a minimum when Ag2O content is 30 mol %, suggests that increasing Ag2O content results in a gradual change of the glass matrix from a two-dimensional layer structure composed of VO5 tetragonal pyramids to a chain structure composed of VO4 tetrahedra. An increase in the Mössbauer parameters observed when the Ag2O content is higher than 30 mol %, corresponding to a metavanadate structure (Ag2O/V2O5=1), indicates a reverse change of the glass matrix into a complicated two- or three-dimensional network structure composed of VO4 tetrahedra. These conclusions are in good agreement with those obtained from a distinct composition dependency of glass transition temperatures (T g). Composition dependency of electrical conductivity at room temperature suggests that the structural change of glass matrix primarily affects the semiconductivity caused by a step-by-step electron hopping from V4+ to V5+ ions.@@@Electrical Conductivity

These were analysed for preferred orientation by flatplate X-ray diffraction to produce equatorial azimuthal densitometry scans/(γ) which were processed to produce the corresponding planar orientation profiles/(φ) corresponding to a Bragg separation of 0.448nm. A further mathematical analysis was applied to these to produce the respective molecular orientation profiles/(α) which may be more directly related to fibre mechanical properties,/(α) profiles from this analysis were matched against theoretical/(α) calculated by assuming an idealized mechanism of affine deformation with no orientation losses due to thermal perturbations. The theoretical draws ratios corresponding to the experimentally observed 〈cos2 α〉 were matched against experimentally observed draw ratios to produce ratios which indicate drawing efficiencies. Although preferred orientation increased with increasing draw ratios, the drawing efficiency diminished with draw ratio.@@@Polymer

Both fibre-dominated quasi-isotropic and matrix dominated ±45 angle-ply layups were investigated.

Classical lamination theory predictions of elastic and strength properties of unnotched specimens are compared with experiments. Several notched geometries, i.e. centre-notched, double-edge notched and open-hole specimens subjected to tensile loading to fracture were examined. The notched strength of the quasi-isotropic laminates was analysed by a damage zone model, where damage around the notch is represented by an “equivalent crack” with cohesive force acting between the crack surfaces.

Good agreement between experimental and calculated strength was observed for the graphite-epoxy laminates which failed in a collinear manner. For the graphite-PEEK laminates discrepancies between predicted and experimental strength are related to observed deviations from collinear crack growth. The angle-ply graphite-PEEK laminates showed larger notch sensitivity than the corresponding graphite-epoxy, probably due to less degree of stress relieving damage formation around the notch.@@@Lamination

Test panels of unsaturated isopthalic polyester resin reinforced with woven E-glass were prepared by hand lay-up and the mass gain occurring during immersion in sea water pressurized up to 80 MPa was monitored. Moisture ingress followed a modified form of Fick's second law of diffusion. The saturation moisture content was shown to be linearly dependent upon the vapour pressure equivalent of hydrostatic pressure. In the case of diffusivity, a systematic relationship with hydrostatic pressure was not observed.@@@Vapour Pressure

An increase in spin density associated with increased Mo(V) concentration is found to occur with increased substrate deposition temperature. Plots of spin density against film thickness show a linear relationship, and reveal a significant residual spin density when extrapolated to zero thickness. Resonance signals are observed atg = 1.92 andg = 2.0 which are attributed to Mo(V) and Mo(III), respectively; that atg = 1.92 vanishes on annealingin vacuo at 250° C. Colour centres observed at higher substrate temperatures are probably due to the presence of Mo(III).@@@Electron Spin Resonance

The maximum moisture content and the initial rate of absorption were determined for specimens maintained at temperatures of 23 and 60° C in atmospheres with relative humidities of 12, 76 and 100%. The swelling of samples immersed in water was also determined. Unlike many other epoxy systems, the maximum moisture content was found to vary appreciably with temperature, as well as with relative humidity, and the initial rate of absorption was found to decrease substantially with increasing relative humidity, especially at higher temperatures. While the maximum moisture content was essentially independent of rubber content and cure treatment, the initial rate of absorption was found to be sensitive to both factors.@@@Polymer

The distribution of the copper between the two main valency states is determined from measurements of e.s.r. arising from the Cu2+ centres. The study of e.s.r. enables the distribution of copper in the glasses between the different valency states to be determined and thus indirectly provides evidence for hopping conduction in the glasses. From the results of e.s.r. and the chemical analysis of the samples it is found that the reduced valency ratioC, i.e. the ratio of the concentration of Cu+ ions to that of total copper in the glass, increases with increasing CuO content.@@@Oxide

A substantial variation in fracture toughness, GIc, with rate was observed at both very high and very low strain rates. Under impact testing conditions, GIc for both pure and rubber-modified epoxies displayed peaks at about 23 and −80° C which appeared to correlate with the corresponding size of the crack tip plastic zone. In order to explain these rate and temperature-dependent GIc results, two separate crack blunting mechanisms were proposed: thermal blunting due to crack tip adiabatic heating and plastic blunting associated with shear yield/flow processes. Thermal blunting was found to occur in the pure- and rubber-modified epoxies under all impact testing conditions and temperatures above 0° C. For temperatures below −20° C under impact conditions, the fracture toughness is dependent on viscoelastic loss processes and not thermal blunting. Plastic blunting was predominant at very slow strain rates less than 10−2 sec−1 for the pure- and rubber-modified epoxies and at impact strain rates for the fibre and hybrid epoxies. Microstructural studies of fracture surfaces provided some essential support for the two proposed crack blunting mechanisms.@@@Epoxy

The specimens were heat treated to produce the same grain size, and the concentration of sulphur at the grain boundaries was controlled by isochronal treatment at various temperatures. The peak height related to the hydrogen released from the grain boundaries decreased with increasing sulphur content at the grain boundaries. It is suggested that the variations in peak height may be attributed to the lowering of the trap binding energy due to sulphur segregation and the site competition effect between the segregated sulphur and hydrogen which are trapped at the grain boundaries.@@@Hydrogen

Serrated grain-boundaries are produced in the early stage of the grain-boundary reaction (GBR) by a heat treatment. Specimens with serrated grain boundaries have superior creep-rupture properties compared with those with normal straight grain boundaries. The rupture lives of specimens with serrated grain boundaries are more than twice as long as those of specimens with straight grain boundaries. The rupture elongation is considerably improved by serrated grain boundaries especially at lower temperatures. A ductile grain-boundary fracture is observed in specimens with serrated grain boundaries, while brittle grain boundary facets prevail in specimens with straight grain boundaries.@@@Polymer

The oxygen content varied significantly, ranging in the bulk from 1.9 to 0.6 at.% and on the surface from 35 to 15 at.%. Surface analysis as obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also indicated that the oxygen species differed significantly with whisker supplier; each of three of the whisker sets contained a surface species that is very similar to that found in a Si-O-C glass, while one whisker surface appeared to have a silica-rich surface. Surface carbon concentrations varied significantly, while silicon concentrations did not.

The oxidation resistance of Al3Ti is much better than that of TiAl, for example, by a factor of about 30 at 1000° C for 48 h. The big difference in the oxidation resistance is related to the characteristics of the external oxide scales of a protective Al2O3 or a mat of crystalline TiO2 formed on Al3Ti or TiAl, respectively. Sufficient aluminium transport from Al3Ti assists the formation of the Al2O3 scale which acts as a protective film against oxidation. The poor aluminium content of TiAl produces Ti3Al phase at the interface of TiAl and oxide scales and increases the diffusivity of titanium in the Al2O3 scale. The external crystalline TiO2 scale produced by the diffusion of titanium through the Al2O3 scale enhances oxidation of TiAl.@@@TiO2

The palladium f c c structure was destroyed by adding boron or phosphorus and the palladium films finally became amorphous in structure. Boron, whose interaction with palladium was very weak, donated electrons to palladium, whereas phosphorus accepted electrons from palladium. The palladium-(boron, phosphorus) films showed high selectivity (above 97%) for the partial hydrogenation of diolefins (cyclopentadiene and 1,3-butadiene) and acetylene. The activity and the selectivity changed with the boron or phosphorus concentration. The changes in the selectivity were explained in terms of the ensemble and the ligand effect in the palladium films.

It has been found that a transitional region exists between the substrate surface and the bulk adhesive in which the physical and/or chemical properties of the polymer differ from those of the bulk polymer. Different surface treatments prior to bonding are observed to have little effect on the formation of the transitional region. Two types of transitional layers have been identified; one extending up to 1μm from the substrate interface, the other generally restricted to 10 nm from the substrate interface. Examination of regions immediately in front of a propagating crack indicate that the interfacial integrity of both an etched-bonded substrate and a pretreated-bonded substrate are maintained. In contrast, regions of the fracture surface behind a propagating crack show the existence of corrosion products on an etched substrate but not on a pretreated substrate.@@@Polymer

The flexural strength and modulus of the unirradiated PEEK/CF were almost the same as those of carbon fibre-reinforced composites with epoxide resin. The mechanical properties at room temperature were little affected by irradiation up to 180 MGy, but in the test at 77 K the strength of the specimens irradiated over 100 MGy were slightly decreased. The mechanical properties of the unirradiated specimen decreased with increasing testing temperature, but the high-temperature properties were improved by irradiation, i.e. the strength measured at 413 K for the specimen irradiated with 120 MGy almost reached the value for the unirradiated specimen measured at room temperature. It was apparent from the viscoelastic measurement that the improvement of mechanical properties at high temperature resulted from the high-temperature shift of the glass transition of the matrix PEEK caused by radiation-induced cross-linking.@@@Polymer

The results are sensitive to the assumed stress concentration factors and length of stress overload region, and there remains considerable interest in characterizing them. In this paper, it is shown how experimental data on the fibres and composites may be used to make inferences about these properties of the material. The statistical technique employed is numerical maximum likelihood, but this involves detailed combinatorial calculations and is therefore highly computationally intensive. The method is illustrated using experimental data on hybrid composites consisting of carbon fibre tows embedded in glass-epoxy composite, particular emphasis being placed on the consequences of varying the distance between the carbon fibre tows.@@@Polymer

One such candidate is 8090, a precipitation hardenable Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloy. Detailed optical microscopical observations were used to analyse the intrinsic microstructural features of the alloy. It is shown that microstructural characteristics have a pronounced influence on tensile properties and fracture behaviour of the alloy in the peak-aged, maximum strength condition. Tensile test results indicate that the alloy has property combinations comparable with other high strength commercial aluminium alloys. The elongation and reduction in area are higher in the transverse direction of the extruded plate. A change in fracture mode was observed with direction of testing. We rationalize such behaviour based on the grain structure of the material, and the nature, distribution and morphology of the second-phase particles. An attempt is made to discuss the kinetics of the fracture process in terms of several competing mechanistic effects involving intrinsic microstructural features, deformation characteristics of the matrix, brittleness of the grain boundary precipitates and grain boundary failure. The role of stress on particle fracture is highlighted.@@@Aluminium Alloy

The first part is devoted to general conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, and describes a procedure for calculating the equilibrium composition of multiphase and multicomponent systems by minimizing the total Gibbs energy of the system while satisfying mass balance conditions. A stoichiometric algorithm convenient especially for equilibrium composition calculations of simple systems is described. Special attention is paid to input data needed for equilibrium calculations. Data characterizing the thermodynamic properties of individual pure substances are discussed, as are data describing the nonideal behaviour of multicomponent condensed phases. The second part of the paper gives a summary of some applications of chemical thermodynamics to the description of processes of special inorganic materials preparation.

The survival of lines was significantly greater in IS (20/20) than in IO (15/20). The competitive index measure of reproductive fitness was significantly lower in the inbred lines than in the outbred base population, but not significantly different in surviving IS and IO lines. There was a trend for higher fitness in the IS treatment as relative fitnesses were 19% higher in IS than IO for surviving lines and 59% higher for all lines. Heterozygosities were lower in the inbred lines than in the base population, and significantly higher in the IS than the IO lines. Consequently, the reduction of inbreeding depression in IS has been achieved, at least in part, by slowing the rate of fixation.@@@Reproductive fitness

The minirhizotron technique is non-destructive and allows for sequential root observations to be made at the same depth in situ. Observations can be stored on video tape which facilitates data handling and computer-aided image processing. A color composite technique using digital image analyses was adapted in this study to detect barley root dynamics from sequential minirhizotron images. Plants were grown in the greenhouse in boxes (80 × 80 × 75 cm) containing soil from a surface horizon of a Typic Cryoboroll. A minirhizotron was installed at a 45°C angle in each box. Roots intersecting the minirhizotron were observed and video-recorded at tillering, stem extension, heading, dough and ripening growth stages. The images from a particular depth were digitized from the analog video then registered to each other. Discrimination of roots from the soil matrix gave quantitative estimates of root appearance and disappearance. Changes in root appearance and disappearance were detected by assigning a separate primary color (red, green, blue) to selected growth stages, then overlaying the images to create red-green and red-green-blue color composites. The resulting composites allowed for a visual interpretation and quantification of barley root dynamics in situ.@@@barley

Ten cases of intracranial haemorrhage, as the initial haemorrhagic event in patients aged from 21 to 55 (haemorrhagic group) and 9 cases of ischaemic events in 18- to 53-year-old patients (ischaemic group) were included. All haemorrhages were associated with intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH); and all but one case of thalamic haemorrhage were thought to be primary IVH (2 cases of small paraventricular haemorrhage; 2 of small haemorrhages in the splenium; 5 with no intracerebral haematoma). In the 9 patients of the ischaemic group, there were 2 cases of transient ischaemic attacks and 7 of cerebral infarction. Angiographic evaluations demonstrated that the abnormal basal vessel formation and the collateral supplies from the external carotid arteries were poorly developed in both groups. In contrast, the collateral circulation via the choroidal and posterior pericallosal arteries was well demonstrated. Furthermore, marked enlargement of the choroidal arteries and the medullary arteries derived from them was seen more frequently in the haemorrhagic group. These findings suggested that the haemodynamic load in the vessels supplying the walls of the posterior parts of the ventricles and the periventricular region was increased, especially in the haemorrhagic group. Those vessels were considered to be important sites of IVH in adult patients with Moyamoya disase.@@@Moyamoya disease

The activity of this lipase against the short-chain lipid tributyrin has been determined over a range of pH and temperature values. Optimum pH conditions were within the range 5.7–6.4 and the optimum temperature was within 37–48 °C. The lipase was also used to catalyze the hydrolysis of monoacid triglycerides (C4∶0–C12∶0) at 40 °C, pH 6.0 and maximum activity was obtained against tributyrin (C4∶0). The values of the kinetic parameter K m increase with increasing carbon-chain length of the carboxylic moiety on the triglycerides, thus, indicating a preference for tributyrin under the stated conditions. The results are compared with results previously obtained utilising goat, kid and lamb pregastric lipases.

"119","Effects of Excitatory Amino Acids on Cerebral Oxygen Consumption and Blood Flow in Rat@@@@@@Issue Date: June 1997@@@This investigation tested the importance of excitatory amino acids' effects on regional cerebral O2 consumption and the concomitant changes in cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in isoflurane anesthetized rats. In the glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) groups, 10−2 M glutamate or NMDA was topically applied to the right cortex and the left cortex was used as a control. One mg/kg dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was administered (iv) to the MK-801 group and saline was given to the control group. Cortical rCBF was determined using 14C-iodoantipyrine and regional O2 extraction was measured microspectrophotometrically. Cerebral O2 consumption increased 77% after glutamate (contralateral cortex: 9.0 ± 1.1 ml O2/min/100 g, glutamate treated cortex: 15.9 ± 3.9), while a 46% increase was observed with the same concentration of NMDA (contralateral cortex: 9.8 ± 2.0, NMDA treated cortex: 14.3 ± 5.5). After MK-801, the O2 consumption decreased to 37% of the control value (control cortex: 7.0 ± 1.3, MK-801 treated cortex: 2.6 ± 3.9). MK-801 significantly decreased cerebral O2 extraction from 7.1 ± 1.3 ml O2/100 ml (control cortex) to 5.3 ± 0.6 (MK-801 treated cortex). However, there was no significant difference in cerebral O2 extraction between treated and contralateral cortex in either the glutamate or NMDA groups. The increase in O2 consumption caused by glutamate or NMDA was coupled with increased rCBF. Glutamate increased rCBF from 95 ± 5 ml/min/100 g (contralateral cortex) to 165 ± 31 (treated cortex), while NMDA increased rCBF from 114 ± 12 (contralateral cortex) to 178 ± 60 (treated cortex). MK-801 decreased O2 consumption with a lesser decrease of rCBF. The rCBF was 48 ± 9 in the MK-801 treated cortex and 99 ± 22 in the control cortex. Some substances produced by the activation of NMDA receptors may be related to the coupling of cerebral metabolism and blood flow, since after blockade of NMDA receptors with MK-801, this relationship is uncoupled. These findings suggest that glutamatergic processes have a major effect on cerebral O2 consumption and that this is at least partly due to NMDA receptors.@@@Glutamate

Sie stellt eine besonders problematische Version des allgemein verbreiteten Identitätsbegriffs dar, dessen Bedeutung im Maße seiner grassierenden Verwendung an Klarheit verloren hat. Faszination hat dieser Begriff gewonnen, weil die Sehnsucht nach Einheit, Ganzheitlichkeit und Einmaligkeit auf ihn projiziert wird. Je unübersichtlicher und entstrukturierter die inneren und äußeren Verhältnisse von Personen werden, um so eher greifen sie auf eine Überschaubarkeit versprechende Vorstellung zurück. Die Verwendung des Begriffs signalisiert also zunächst einmal krisenhafte Erfahrungen; die Notwendigkeit zur Selbstvergewisserung ist ein Element von Krisen — ob sie durch die Rückwendung zu einem Zustand, in dem man »Identität« vermutet, bewältigt werden können, ist mehr als offen. Denn ein unvermittelter Rückgriff auf »alte« Gewißheiten kann in der Regel nur kurzfristig Sicherheit vermitteln. Dauerhaft können Krisen nur in der Bewältigung der mit ihnen verbundenen Entwicklungsaufgaben überwunden werden, was in der Regel die Erarbeitung neuer »Identitäten« erfordert.@@@"

Eingedenk der Machtfrage aber ergibt sich die Brisanz des Themas.

Specifically I wish to suggest that this equation underpins much of the present educational thinking and practice in relation to multicultural/pluricultural societies. On the one hand I want to do so by suggesting that other modes of communication are becoming more significant (or, that the significance of other modes of communication is coming to be recognized) and that this forces a re-evaluation of language in any case. On the other hand I want to suggest that different modes of communication afford distinct potentials (and come with distinct limitations) for engagement with the. natural and the social world. Modes of communication are therefore likely to be representationally and communicationally specialized. In this respect, and as with language, the effects of socio-cultural actions over time will of course have led to culturally distinct codes in these modes of representation, just as they have in relation to language. The political and ethical questions of equity and access, as well as the pedagogical questions of learning and cognition therefore arise in relation to other modes of representation and communication.@@@"

"137","Effect of Catheter Tip Length and Position on Lesion Volume in Temperature Controlled RF Ablation in Canine Tricuspid Valve Annulus@@@@@@Issue Date: September 1998@@@Background: Radiofrequency (RF) energy has been delivered to the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) in humans with both 4 mm and 8 mm long catheter tip electrodes to treat atrial flutter. However, lesion volume with temperature controlled RF delivery systems has not been previously characterized.

Methods: In 10 anesthetized canines, a single pulse of temperature controlled RF energy at a 70°C set point, 30 second duration was delivered with either a 7 Fr/4 mm tip or a 7 Fr/8 mm tip electrode in a position both anterolateral and posteroseptal to the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA). Surface echocardiogram was obtained prior and after ablation. The animals were sacrificed after ablation and the lesions underwent gross and histological examination.

Results: Lesion size, tip temperature and power were related to tip electrode surface area (SA). Eight mm tips (SA = 59 mm2) tended to create significantly larger lesions than 4 mm tips (SA = 29 mm2). Median lesion volume was 22 vs. 1.5 mm3, respectively. Eight mm tips were also associated with higher power requirements and lower temperatures than 4 mm tips. Posteroseptal TVA lesions tended to be larger than anterolateral lesions. No significant complications were noted.

Conclusions: Using temperature controlled RF ablation, large lesions may be safely created on the canine TVA using 7 Fr catheters with 8 mm long tips.@@@radiofrequency ablation

The proposed model, similar to the Stokes equations of the fluid mechanics, allows one to get a set of admissible paths and is applicable to multi-goal problems for robotic vehicles on uneven terrain. The latter planning is obtained without additional computation.

A point-to-point application on a real terrain has been compared to the genetic algorithms principles applied to the computation of near-optimal routes and gives similar results, while directly adding continuity in the velocities and accelerations without additional trajectory smoothing.

The method is also an interesting way to get preferential routes for indoor industrial robots and motorised aids for the disabled.

Further research will include optimising the terrain meshing in order to reduce the number of equations, and experiments on the site with the robot.

The planned routes are also currently under investigation for multiple-robot behaviour optimisation, following the multiple-agent theories with communication.

This will ultimately lead to cheaper less complex robots. Further work is necessary to provide further cues as to the nature of the robot-network communications in real healthcare environments. The effects of varying network traffic and the latencies incurred can only become evident when the robots are situated in a more active environment.

It has been stressed the efficiency of the collaboration of three integrated methods of localisation. It appears that the main advantage of such a localisation system lies in its ability to integrate heterogeneous sensor information and so to be configurable depending on the environment encountered.

However, the purpose of that architecture is not just to estimate the position of the robot. Its matching and its integration of the information provide a sorting out of the information intended to the next two steps of the perception module that are rough mapping and refined mapping. The rough mapping issue makes use of the integrated information to provide a safety modelling of the environment. The refined mapping issue exploits the information rejected by the matching to update a static modelling of the environment.

"143","H∞ robust control system design for a 3-DOF robot manipulator@@@@@@Published: 24 September 2007 Publisher Name: Springer, London Print ISBN: 978-1-85233-123-8 Online ISBN: 978-1-84628-535-6 eBook Packages: Springer Book Archive@@@A robot with feedback linearization on each of its links was modeled from experimental frequency data and a family of non-parametric models were derived for different configurations of the robot. Based on this family of multivariable models a nominal model for the plant was determined and non-parametric model perturbations were obtained to account for additive unstructured uncertainties from neglected dynamics and nonlinearities. These models prove to be essential in the process of design of the robust controller by the H ∞ methodology. The experimental results showed that the controlled closed loop system achieved robust stability and robust performance. In addition to this the controlled system shows no-interaction between the links. A side effect of the controller is to slow the time response of the system as compared with the actual system. A final comment is that the controller presented in this paper is been implemented on ROBIX.

"144","Enhancement of a telemanipulator design with a human arm model@@@@@@Published: 24 September 2007 Publisher Name: Springer, London Print ISBN: 978-1-85233-123-8 Online ISBN: 978-1-84628-535-6 eBook Packages: Springer Book Archive@@@In this chapter we described how the inclusion of a model of a human arm, combined with the measurement of its neural input and a predictor, can provide to a previously proposed teleoperator design robustness under time delay. Our trials gave clear indications of the superiority of the NPT scheme over traditional as well as the modified Yokokohji and Yoshikawa architectures. Its fundamental advantages are: the time-lead of the slave, the more efficient, and providing a more natural feeling manipulation, and the fact that incorporating an operator arm model leads to more credible stability results. Finally, its simplicity allows less likely to fail local control techniques to be employed.

However, a significant advantage for the enhanced Yokokohji and Yoshikawa architecture results from the very fact that it’s a conservative modification of current designs. Under large prediction errors, it can provide robustness through directing the master and slave states to their means and, since it relies on the passivity of the mechanical part of the system, it would not confuse the operator.

An experimental implementation of the techniques will provide further evidence for the performance of the proposed architectures. The employment of neural networks and fuzzy logic, which will provide an adaptive model of the human arm and robustifying control terms, is scheduled for the near future.

During this work, simulations using IGRIP and other related analysis software tools have been important during the development work to analyze and evaluate the design including kinematics, dynamics, controller evaluation of conceptual design solutions and virtual scenarios.

The concurrent development of the mechanics and the controller is facilitated through a robotic simulator that speed up the project work and reduces the technical risk of failure. This is an important factor in complex projects with time constraints where a failure in any part of the project may affect the whole project. In this case, testing and validation can be done on almost every detail in the project. Furthermore, even if a failure occur in the controller which can not be resolved during the lifetime of the project the robot arm can be driven using the simulator with some degradation in real time performance only. Furthermore, virtual scenarios are modeled and simulated that will provide the project team and intended users with a realistic tool to discuss user requirements and user interfaces with the intended users before the robot exist.

"148","Monolayer-Mediated Patterning of Integrated Electroceramics@@@@@@Issue Date: June 1999@@@Integrated electroceramic thin-film devices on semiconducting or insulating substrate materials offer a wide variety of attractive attributes, including high capacitance density, nonvolatile memory, sensor/actuator ability, and other unique electrical, electromechanical, magnetic and optical functions. Thus the ability to pattern such electroceramic thin films is a critical technology for future device realization. Patterned oxide thin-film devices are typically formed by uniform film deposition followed by somewhat complicated post-deposition ion-beam or chemical etching in a controlled environment i.e., a subtractive method. We review here an upset technology, a different way of patterning, by an additive approach, which allows for the selective deposition of electroceramic thin layers without such post-deposition etching. In this method, substrate surfaces are selectively functionalized with hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers to modify the adhesion of subsequently deposited solution-derived electroceramics. The selective functionalization is achieved through microcontact printing (μ-CP) of self-assembled monolayers of the chemical octadecyltrichlorosilane on substrates of current technical interest. Subsequent sol-gel deposition of ceramic oxides on these functionalized substrates, followed by lift-off from the monolayer, yields high quality, patterned oxide thin layers only on the unfunctionalized regions. A variety of micron-scale dielectric oxide devices have been fabricated by this method, with lateral resolution as fine as 0.5 μm. In this paper, we review the monolayer patterning and electrical behavior of several patterned electroceramic thin films, including Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 [PZT], LiNbO3, and Ta2O5. A multilevel example is also given which combines selective MOCVD deposition of metal electrodes and sol-gel patterned PZT for Pt//PZT//Pt//Si(100) ferroelectric memory cells.@@@chemical solution processing

"149","Calcium efflux from platelet vesicles of the dense tubular system. Analysis of the possible contribution of the Ca2+ pump@@@@@@Issue Date: September 1999@@@The ATP dependent Ca2+ uptake of platelet vesicles was inhibited by the two hydrophobic drugs trifluoperazine (TFP) and propranolol (PROP). Inhibition was significantly lowered when Pi was used instead of oxalate as a precipitant agent. When the ATPase ligands substrate (Mg2+ and Pi) were absent of the efflux medium, a slow release of Ca2+ which did not couple with ATP synthesis (passive Ca2+ efflux) was observed. Both, TFP and PROP enhanced the passive Ca2+ efflux. This enhanced efflux was partially inhibited only when Mg2+ and Pi were added together to the efflux reaction media, but it was not affected by spermidine, ruthenium red or thapsigargin (TG). The Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin, also enhanced passive Ca2+ efflux. However, in this case, Ca2+ efflux was inhibited just by inclusion of Mg2+ to the medium. Ca2+ efflux promoted by Triton X-100 was not affected by either Mg2+ or Pi, included together or separately into the efflux medium. The ATP ⇌ Pi measured in the presence of Triton X-100 and millimolar Ca2+ concentrations was inhibited by both TFP and PROP, but not by Ca2+ ionophores up to 4 μM. The data suggest that the observed enhancement of passive Ca2+ efflux promoted by TFP and PROP could be attributed to a direct effect of these drugs over the platelet Ca2+ pump isoforms (Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase, SERCA2b and SERCA3) themselves, as it was reported for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1).@@@Ca2+ ATPase

These differed in the size or the shape of their nozzles. Such reactors were able to ash an organic compound (OFPR-800; a photoresist) even at atmospheric pressure. The results showed that the following procedures are important for increasing the ashing rate: to make the gas speed after blowing out fast; to decrease the O2 content while increasing the gas speed; and to use a gas mixture which has a slow decay rate of the active species, such as the oxygen radicals. Especially, when we used O2/Ar mixture gas for the ashing treatment, the ashing rate became quite fast and was as fast as that of a general low pressure glow plasma.@@@Ashing

"151","Grain boundaries of nanocrystalline materials – their widths, compositions, and internal structures@@@@@@Issue Date: January 2000@@@Nanocrystalline materials contain many atoms at and near grain boundaries. Sufficient numbers of Mössbauer probe atoms can be situated in grain boundary environments to make a clear contribution to the measured Mössbauer spectrum. Three types of measurements on nanocrystalline materials are reported here, all using Mössbauer spectrometry in conjunction with X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, or small angle neutron scattering. By measuring the fraction of atoms contributing to the grain boundary component in a Mössbauer spectrum, and by knowing the grain size of the material, it is possible to deduce the average width of grain boundaries in metallic alloys. It is found that these widths are approximately 0.5 nm for fcc alloys and slightly larger than 1.0 nm for bcc alloys.

Chemical segregation to grain boundaries can be measured by Mössbauer spectrometry, especially in conjunction with small angle neutron scattering. Such measurements on Fe-Cu and Fe3Si-Nb were used to study how nanocrystalline materials could be stabilized against grain growth by the segregation of Cu and Nb to grain boundaries. The segregation of Cu to grain boundaries did not stabilize the Fe-Cu alloys against grain growth, since the grain boundaries were found to widen and accept more Cu atoms during annealing. The Nb additions to Fe3Si did suppress grain growth, perhaps because of the low mobility of Nb atoms, but also perhaps because Nb atoms altered the chemical ordering in the alloy.

The internal structure of grain boundaries in nanocrystalline materials prepared by high-energy ball milling is found to be unstable against internal relaxations at low temperatures. The Mössbauer spectra of the nanocrystalline samples showed changes in the hyperfine fields attributable to movements of grain boundary atoms. In conjunction with SANS measurements, the changes in grain boundary structure induced by cryogenic exposure and annealing at low temperature were found to be somewhat different. Both were consistent with a sharper density gradient between the crystalline region and the grain boundary region.@@@57Fe Atom

"152","Ecology of the Hybridogenetic Rana esculenta Complex: Differential Oxygen Requirements of Tadpoles@@@@@@Issue Date: January 2000@@@Because of intrinsic demographic load induced by hybridogenesis (infertility of homotypic hybrid matings), the maintenance of hybrid lineages supposes that they present better performances (heterosis) than their host species which allows them to coexist on a long-term basis. However, this necessity of high fitness can be relaxed if a relative niche partitioning occurs between the taxa, each of them differing in their ecological optima. In the waterfrog hybridogenetic complex (Rana esculenta complex), recent studies have revealed that hybrids show intermediate distribution between parental species across a gradient of river influence (that is related to a gradient of oxygen levels), and intermediate performances of their tadpoles with regard to oxygen availability (hypoxia). In investigating oxygen consumption rates, survival time in anoxia, and metabolite contents in the three forms of the complex, the present study confirms intermediate characteristics of hybrid tadpoles (R. esculenta) when compared to both parental lineages (R. lessonae and R. ridibunda). Whereas R. ridibunda tadpoles were the most sensitive to anoxia, R. lessonae tadpoles were the most tolerant. Because oxygen requirements of the hybrid proved to be intermediate, no heterosis was detected. These results confirm the hypothesis of the intermediate niche hypothesis to explain the coexistence of R. lessonae and R. esculenta and the success of the hybridogens.@@@habitat selection

A 3.5 kb sequence 5′ upstream of the ATG codon of the wheat FKBP73 was isolated from a wheat genomic library, and characterized by deletion analysis and transient expression in wheat embryos. The 1517 bp fragment is referred to as the full promoter due to the maximal activity of the fused luciferase reporter gene. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive elements (ABREs) proximal to coupling elements (CE1-like), a putative lectin box, two putative binding sites for the myb transcription factor and a 36 bp fragment which exhibits 100% identity to the pSau3A9 clone located in the centromeric region of wheat chromosomes. In a transient expression assay the promoter preserved the tissue specificity described in vivo, namely it is expressed only in germinating embryos and young shoots. The promoter was induced 1.9-fold by ABA, the minimal promoter was designated at −221 and the TATA box located at −137. The inducibility by ABA and the expression during germination may indicate that FKBP73 belongs to the group of genes induced by ABA upon germination.@@@ABA-responsive

Firstly, a plasmid containing a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter (Ubi1), was bombarded into both friable embryogenic callus and proembryos. Transient and stable expression of luciferase was visually detected by a luminometer. This selection method is non-destructive and can be applied over the whole developmental process from callus to embryo and plantlet. Molecular proof of transformation was obtained both by PCR analysis and Southern hybridization. Secondly, a plasmid containing the bar gene together with an uidA gene coding for β-glucuronidase both driven by the Ubi1 promoter was bombarded into proembryos. The transgenic callus was effectively selected from the callus clumps four months after bombardment on a medium containing 5 mg/l phosphinotricin (PPT). Selection by PPT was efficient and labour-saving. Stable expression of GUS was confirmed by the histochemical staining assay and molecular proof was obtained by PCR analysis.@@@Alstroemeria

We provide information on adjusted mean daily intake of foods and nutrients, by means of a dietary history, from those people self-reported as having high blood pressure as well as from those self-reported as normotensive but having, after actual blood-pressure measurement, systolic or diastolic blood pressures of ≥ 160/95 mmHg. Although with small differences in mean intake people who self-reported high blood pressure have a higher consumption of potatoes, vegetables, vitamin C and E; furthermore, men reported an increased intake of fruit, meat, fish, proteins, dietary fibre, β-carotene and alcohol, and women tended to consume less alcohol, lipids and cholesterol but more proteins, carbohydrates and dietary fibre. Almost no differences are found in fatty acid intake. This pattern is reversed among those self-reported as normotensive but with high blood pressure after actual measurement. We conclude that in this large prospective cohort, awareness or not of having high blood pressure at recruitment is associated with a differential dietary pattern.@@@Diet

However, a number of evidences have been accumulated suggesting that apoptotic cell death is implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic and organ specific autoimmune diseases. In addition, recognition and engulfement of apoptotic cells by professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, and their interaction with effector immune cells have been recently described to result in apoptotic cell-derived antigen specific tolerance.

We have obtained a steady-state conductivity change of greater than eight orders of magnitude effected through iodine vapor doping of PFS. The sign of thermoelectric power measurements indicates p-type conductivity. The conductivity exhibits an activation energy of ΔE=(0.45–0.65) eV for moderately-doped samples and ΔE=(0.8–0.99) eV for heavily-doped samples. We report sample photoconductivity, which we find to be principally of bolometric origin. We also study the evolution of electrical properties over time: during several days after fabrication, the samples exhibit an irreversible decrease in conductivity which may be attributable to partial iodine desorption. After this aging process, especially noticeable in heavily doped material, the sample properties stabilize, suggesting promise in a range of prospective device applications. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers@@@Activation Energy

ESEs are attributed to either (1) a preference for more positive outcomes in lotteries, or (2) an aversion to more zero outcomes. An experiment is reported which replicates ESEs whilst controlling for explanation (2). This favours explanation (1), but a lack of generality in replication suggests previous ESEs to be partially due to (2).

Technetium-99m-labeled myocardial perfusion tracers allow simultaneous assessment of myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function by electrocardiography-gated scan. This study was performed to determine whether dobutamine stress electrocardiography-gated tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can identify viable (as defined by positron emission tomography [PET]) but dysfunctional myocardium with contractile reserve.

Methods and Results

Thirty-five patients with myocardial infarction underwent resting electrocardiography-gated SPECT and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. The relative uptakes of tetrofosmin (%tetrofosmin) and FDG (%FDG) were calculated. Wall motion in 9 left ventricular segments was assessed at rest and during dobutamine stress on a 3-dimensional cine-mode display created with automatic left ventricular function analysis software. A total of 129 dysfunctional segments were analyzed. Forty-five (48.9%) of 92 segments with % tetrofosmin of 50% or greater and only 4 (10.8%) of 37 segments with % tetrofosmin less than 50% had contractile reserves (P < 0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of % tetrofosmin of 50% or greater for detecting %FDG of 50% or greater were 85.7%, 74%, and 82.9%, respectively. The incidence of the presence of contractile reserve rose with increasing magnitude of %FDG. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the presence of contractile reserve for detecting %FDG of 50% or greater were 43.9%, 80.6%, and 52.7%, respectively.

While only a small proportion of married women participate in the labor force in South Korea, the vast majority of Korean immigrant wives work outside the home, most working long hours. Parallel to the increase in Korean women's economic role, their husbands' provider role and social status have significantly weakened with immigration. Despite Korean women's increase in their economic role, most Korean husbands have not modified a rigid form of patriarchal ideology brought from Korea because they are socially segregated from the mainstream society. A big clash between Korean women's active economic role and their husbands' traditional patriarchal attitudes causes serious marital conflicts in many Korean immigrant families. In addition, Korean partners' (particularly husbands') frustrations over their downward social mobility, the long hours spent together in the family store, and their midlife crisis are additional causes of marital conflicts. Other contemporary immigrant groups, mostly from non-European, Third World countries, seem to encounter lower, but similar marital conflicts caused by sudden changes in women's gender role.@@@immigrant families

"167","Delayed orchiectomy after chemotherapy in patients with advanced testicular cancer@@@@@@Issue Date: December 2001@@@Introduction: The therapeutic procedures in the management of testicular cancer are determined by histological findings in the removed testis and by the extent of the disease at the time of diagnosis. However, all advanced tumors could be treated by primary chemotherapy regardless of the histological findings. The current imaging techniques (ultrasound of the testis, abdominal and chest CT examination) and laboratory tests (determination of serum tumor markers AFP and hCG) provide sufficient evidence for the presence of cancer. When the diagnosis of advanced tumor is evident, it is possible to start the treatment without orchiectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantages of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with delayed orchiectomy in the management of advanced testicular cancer. Material and methods: A total of 36 patients with advanced germ cell testicular cancer underwent primary PVB or BEP chemotherapy without previous orchiectomy. Mean age of patients was 32 years. Detailed medical, surgical and urological examination showed pulmonary metastases and/or extensive abdominal tumorous masses imitating acute abdominal crisis and impaired drainage of the kidney due to ureteral obstruction. Searching for the origin, testicular tumor was detected. Eleven patients had a bulky disease in the retroperitoneum (Stage IIC), two had enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Stage IIB), two had enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (Stage III) and other 16 patients had also pulmonary metastases, and 5 pts had pulmonary metastases only. The patients were treated with cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy. Following completion of chemotherapy, orchiectomy was performed alone or simultaneously with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) and/or lung metastasectomy in cases with persistent residual mass. Following orchiectomy the patients were regularly checked and in cases with viable malignant tumor found in the testis sequential chemotherapy was administered. Similarly when the relapse of the disease was detected, the patients were treated with sequential chemotherapy. Results: Complete disappearance of metastases was observed in 12 patients following chemotherapy alone. The residual mass persisted in 24 patients (in 22 out of them in the retroperitoneum and in two patients also in the lungs) and was removed surgically. The viable tumor in the removed tissue was found in one patient. Delayed orchiectomy was performed simultaneously with surgical removal of residual mass in the retroperitoneum in 24 patients and as a separate procedure in 12 patients who have been considered to be complete responders following chemotherapy alone. Residual viable tumor in testicular specimen was found in three patients, necrotic or fibrotic tissue in 18, and mature teratoma in 15 patients. Overall survival of the patients was 26/36 (72.7%) at mean of 56.9 months (range 7–145 months, median 50 months) since the start of the treatment. Conclusions: In patients with advanced germ cell testicular cancer preference must be given to the early beginning of intensive chemotherapy without the need of tissue diagnosis of primary tumor that should be obtained by orchiectomy. Benefit of this therapeutic approach is the timely management of acute abdominal and/or pulmonary symptoms of life-threatening distant metastases.@@@Pulmonary Metastasis

The conventional split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus is modified by shaping the incident pulse such that the samples are in dynamic stress equilibrium and have nearly constant strain rate over most of the test duration. A thin disk of annealed or hard C11000 copper is placed on the impact surface of the incident bar in order to shape the incident pulse. After impact by the striker bar, the copper disk deforms plastically and spreads the pulse in the incident bar. We present an analytical model and data that show a wide variety of incident strain pulses can be produced by varying the geometry of the copper disks and the length and striking velocity of the striker bar. Model predictions are in good agreement with measurements. In addition, we present data for a machineable glass ceramic material, Macor, that shows pulse shaping is required to obtain dynamic stress equilibrium and a nearly constant strain rate over most of the test duration.@@@Hopkinson bar

"169","Investigation of hyaluronan function in the mouse through targeted mutagenesis@@@@@@Issue Date: May 2002@@@It has become increasingly apparent that the high molecular mass glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA), is required for many morphogenetic processes during vertebrate development. This renewed understanding of the various developmental roles for HA, has come about largely through the advent of gene targeting approaches in the mouse. To date, mutations have been engineered in the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and degradation and for those proteins that bind to HA within the extracellular matrix and at the cell surface. Collectively, the phenotypes resulting from these mutations demonstrate that HA is critical for normal mammalian embryogenesis and for various processes in postnatal and adult life (Table 1). In this article we will review our progress in understanding the biological functions for HA through targeted mutagenesis of the HA synthase 2 (Has2) and 3 (Has3) genes. Data that has been obtained from a conventional targeted disruption of the Has2 gene, is presented in an accompanying review by Camenisch and McDonald. More specifically, in this review we will provide an overview of the conditional gene targeting strategy being used to create tissue-specific deficiencies in Has2 function, along with our progress in understanding the role for Has3-dependent HA biosynthesis.

"171","Prescribing errors involving medication dosage forms@@@@@@Issue Date: August 2002@@@CONTEXT: Prescribing errors involving medication dose formulations have been reported to occur frequently in hospitals. No systematic evaluations of the characteristics of errors related to medication dosage formulation have been performed.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the characteristics, frequency, and potential adverse patient effects of prescribing errors involving medication dosage forms.

DESIGN: Evaluation of all detected medication prescribing errors involving or related to medication dosage forms in a 631-bed tertiary care teaching hospital.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type, frequency, and potential for adverse effects of prescribing errors involving or related to medication dosage forms.

RESULTS: A total of 1,115 clinically significant prescribing errors involving medication dosage forms were detected during the 60-month study period. The annual number of detected errors increased throughout the study period. Detailed analysis of the 402 errors detected during the last 16 months of the study demonstrated the most common errors to be: failure to specify controlled release formulation (total of 280 cases; 69.7%) both when prescribing using the brand name (148 cases; 36.8%) and when prescribing using the generic name (132 cases; 32.8%); and prescribing controlled delivery formulations to be administered per tube (48 cases; 11.9%). The potential for adverse patient outcome was rated as potentially “fatal or severe” in 3 cases (0.7%), and “serious” in 49 cases (12.2%). Errors most commonly involved cardiovascular agents (208 cases; 51.7%).

CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients are at risk for adverse outcomes due to prescribing errors related to inappropriate use of medication dosage forms. This information should be considered in the development of strategies to prevent adverse patient outcomes resulting from such errors.@@@medication errors

The model was characterized using the ceramic, β-tricalcium phosphate (βTCP) as a filler. A 1 mm wide, 3.6 mm deep defect was created around a stainless steel (SS) implant in the proximal tibia of a rat. This defect was filled with a ceramic powder. Large particles (90–312μm) of βTCP were mixed with Gelfoam® to form a paste which was then molded around the proximal end of either an uncoated SS pin or a pin coated with hydroxyapatite (HA). The pin with its ceramic collar was then implanted into the proximal tibia of 16 male Sprague Dawley rats. Two animals with coated implants and two with uncoated implants were sacrificed at 3, 6, 14 and 26 weeks. Longitudinal sections of each tibia were stained with toluidine blue and labeled for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). There was initial fibrous tissue interposition around the implants which was completely remodeled around the HA coated pins but which persisted in apposition to the SS pins. The remodeling process peaked at 3 weeks around the HA coated pins and at 6 weeks around the uncoated implants. There was little remodeling around either implant by 26 weeks. There was considerable residual βTCP present which was well tolerated as the particles were often encased in bone. The model has several characteristics of revision arthroplasty and the results demonstrate the suitability of this model for testing bone substitutes.@@@Hydroxyapatite

"173","Wisdom, casuistry, and the goal of reproductive counseling@@@@@@Issue Date: October 2002@@@Reproductive counseling includes counseling of prospective parents by obstetricians, clinical geneticists, and genetic counselors regarding, for example, the use of assisted reproductive technologies, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Two different views on wisdom and the goal of reproductive counseling are analyzed. According to the first view, the goal of reproductive counseling is to help prospective parents reach a wise decision. A specific course of action is recommended by the counselor in contrast to other possible alternatives. According to the second view, the goal of reproductive counseling is not to help prospective parents reach a wise decision but to help them reach their own decision wisely. It is the prospective parents who should make the decision, and it is their value commitments that should be decisive. It is argued that the second approach is to be preferred to the first. It combines respect for autonomy with a recognition of the need for assistance in decision-making. Both the first and second views relate the goal of reproductive counseling to wisdom. A problem is, however, what wisdom more precisely means — there are many different views. A casuistic view of wisdom is investigated. This view roughly defines wisdom as practical prudence in dealing with particular cases. What characterizes a casuistic decision-making method is elaborated in more detail. Applied to the second view, a casuistic view of wisdom implies that the counselor should encourage prospective parents to take into consideration the nature of the particular problem at hand, the context of the problem, their own individual identities, their personal value commitments, and various alternative perspectives, values and arguments.@@@assisted reproductive technologies

This catalyst showed good resistance to carbon deposition, which in this reaction and in CH4 decomposition was investigated by means of XPS and TEM. It is suggested that nano-tube-like carbon is an intermediate in this reaction and a spillover of carbon from crystalline Ni onto the hexaaluminate oxide occurred during the reaction.@@@methane

This results firstly in the identification of a charge transfer process between dopant atoms and hydrogen interstitials that provides a new mechanism for dopant passivation. It is concluded, however, that the increase in the diamagnetic fraction with temperature in doped a-Si:H can only be explained by the diffusion of hydrogen interstitials to charged dangling bond sites. These two interactions, of interstitial hydrogen and dopants on the one hand, and hydrogen and dangling bond defects on the other, are then used to propose a hydrogen pathway between dopants and dangling bond defects that explains why the process of doping amorphous silicon is always accompanied by the formation of charged dangling bonds.@@@Hydrogen

"178","Kinetics of Catalase Inactivation Induced by Ultrasonic Cavitation@@@@@@Issue Date: March 2003@@@Kinetic patterns of sonication-induced inactivation of bovine liver catalase (CAT) were studied in buffer solutions (pH 4.0–11.0) within the temperature range from 36 to 55oС. Solutions of CAT were exposed to LF (20.8 kHz) ultrasound (specific power, 48–62 W/cm2). The kinetics of CAT inactivation was characterized by effective first-order rate constants (s–1) of total inactivation (k in), thermal inactivation (*k in), and ultrasonic inactivation (k in(us)). In all cases, the following inequality was valid: k in > *k in. The value of k in(us) increased with the ultrasound power (range, 48–62 W/cm2) and exhibited a strong dependence on the pH of the medium. On increasing initial concentration of CAT (0.4–4.0 nM), k in(us) decreased. The three rate constants were minimum within the range pH 6.5–8.0; their values increased considerably at pH < 6.0 and pH > 9.0. At 36–55oС, the temperature dependence of k in(us) was characterized by an activation energy (E act) of 19.7 kcal/mol, whereas the value of E act for CAT thermoinactivation was equal to 44.2 kcal/mol. Bovine and human serum albumins (BSA and HSA, respectively) inhibited sonication-induced CAT inactivation; complete prevention was observed at concentrations above 2.5 μg/ml. Dimethyl formamide (DMFA), a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (НO•), prevented sonication-induced CAT inactivation at 10% (k in and *k in increased with the content of DMFA at concentrations in excess of 3%). The results obtained indicate that free radicals generated in the field of ultrasonic cavitation play a decisive role in the inactivation of CAT, which takes place when its solutions are exposed to low-frequency ultrasound. However, the efficiency of CAT inactivation by the radicals is determined by (1) the degree of association between the enzyme molecules in the reaction medium and (2) the composition thereof.@@@Catalase

We argue that decisions based on policy rules should take into account the possibility for the users to enable specific policy rules, by performing actions at the time when decisions are being rendered, and/or by promising to perform other actions in the future. Decisions should also consider preferences among different sets of actions enabling different rules. We adopt a formalism and mechanism devised for policy rule management in this context, and investigate in detail the notion of obligations, which are those actions users promise to perform in the future upon firing of a specific policy rule. We also investigate how obligations can be monitored and how the policy rules should be affected when obligations are either fulfilled or defaulted.@@@Obligation monitoring

"180","A forest planning model for continuous employment in a forested village with primarily young stands in Korea@@@@@@Issue Date: January 2005@@@This paper presents a practical forest planning approach for continuous forest-based employment in a forested village with primarily young stands. The model is designed to find the practice level for continuous forest employment which embraces both the goal of maximizing the total forest employment and the constraint of maintaining its annual balance, considering forest size and condition, and budget available for forest practice. Through controlling the practice level with the help of a desired employment effect that contributes to allocating forest practices equally to each plan year, a marginal practice level can be found under which any practice level fulfills the goal and constraints. The potential practice area, which is determined by forest area, stand age, and practice schedule, contributes to determining the area silviculturally available for forest practice. Our forest planning model is focused on the planning of young forests which are not expected to yield merchantable products in the near term. The model can also be characterized by landscape-level forest planning in which stand-level practices are planned for achieving a forest-level goal of continuous forest employment. Thus, the model can serve as a basic planning tool for maintaining healthy forests as well as continuous forest employment in young forest areas, where forest-level goals are predicated on stand level practices.@@@Continuous forest employment

Each provenance test lot consisted of seed from 7 to 10 individual trees collected in natural stands. Range-wide samples were included in the test for P. greggii var. australis and P. patula. Material of P. maximinoi and P. tecunumanii from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico was established in the test. The test site is in a mountainous area at 1440 m elevation, near 20 °N latitude. At 5 years of age significant differences were seen at both the species and provenance levels in survival, total height, diameter and volume. The overall test survival was 93%. Variance among species was three time greater than among provenances, comprising 25–33% of the total variation. P. maximinoi had the greatest height, diameter and volume (62 dm3) followed by P. tecunumanii (53 dm3). P. greggii var. australis had an average volume of 43 dm3 and P. patula produced 30 dm3. Although P. maximinoi had the lowest survival rate, the San Jeronimo provenance was the most productive of all 30 provenances tested; 98% survival and 73 dm3 volume. This was equivalent to 2.8 cm annual diameter increment and 2 m in height growth per year. Significant growth differences among provenances within species indicate that potential gain exists using provenance selection.@@@Pinus greggii var. australis

Cole State forest, southeastern Australia: analysis of browsing patterns, spatial relationships and browse selection@@@@@@Issue Date: January 2005@@@Browsing by mammals can have a substantial impact on the survival, growth and form of regenerating forest trees. This study investigated the severity and distribution of mammalian browsing damage, and the degree to which eucalypt seedlings (Eucalyptus spp.) were selected for browsing on three regenerating native forest coupes in southeastern Australia. Damage was greatest 6 months after eucalypt germination and at this time, both messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) and blue gum (E. globulus) seedlings were browsed at similar intensity. Nine and 12 months after germination, messmate was browsed more heavily than blue gum. Consistent relationships between browsing damage and both distance from the forest edge and wallaby density were not observed. Analysis of use and availability data for messmate, blue gum and manna gum (E. viminalis) seedlings showed that messmate was selected for browsing more than expected by chance while manna gum was browsed less than expected. Mammalian browsing affects a substantial portion of Victoria’s native forest estate, and could alter the species composition of future forests. Research into the ecology of browsing species and the development of non-lethal browsing reduction strategies is seen as a priority for the management of mammalian browsing in Victoria.@@@Browse

Henry) in a plantation on Vancouver Island. Treatments were applied shortly after planting. Nitrogen (0, 500 kg N ha−1) was supplied as ammonium sulfate (AS); half of the AS was added at the start of the second growing season. Phosphorus (0, 100, 200 kg P ha−1) was supplied as triple super phosphate (TSP), rock phosphate (RP), or diammonium phosphate (DAP) and banded or broadcast. Over four growing seasons, stem volumes increased with AS and P additions. The effects of AS and P each were greatest when the other was also added. Volume was greater when P was applied at 100 kg ha−1 than in the P control and did not significantly increase further at 200 kg P ha−1. Phosphorus additions were more effective when added as TSP or DAP than when added as RP, but only in P100 and when banded. Banding increased volume when P was applied at 200 kg ha−1, but increases were significant only for DAP fertilized trees. Roto-tilling associated with the banding treatment also increased volume when AS and P were not added. Rankings of clones with respect to stem volume varied with N supply and changed over time.@@@Fertilizer placement

Our results showed that inoculation using dissolved alginate beads containing rhizobia significantly improved the growth of both acacia species better than the growth of plants in other treatments. The experiment with A. nilotica was conducted in two unsterilised soils from different areas. Plants grown in soil from Bel Air were well-nodulated and showed better growth than plants grown in soil from Sangalkam. However, no difference between these soils was shown between the several methods of inoculation and their effect on the nodulation and growth of plants. An interaction between A. senegal and A. nilotica provenances and the effect of inoculation with rhizobia was also demonstrated. Bel Air provenance of A. senegal, Dahra and RIM provenances of A. nilotica grew best of several provenances tested. These results suggest that (1) it may be possible to improve growth and yield of A. senegal and A. nilotica by careful selection of each symbiotic partner; and (2) nursery-grown seedlings of A. senegal and A. nilotica should be inoculated, just after sowing, with dissolved alginate beads containing a mixture of selected rhizobia.

Résumé.

L’object de notre travail était de déterminer la méthodologie d’inoculation la plus efficace pour améliorer significativement la nodulation et la croissance d’Acacia senegal et d’Acacia nilotica poussant dans des conditions de serre. Nos résultats ont montré que l’inoculation utilisant des billes d’alginate dissoutes améliorait significativement la croissance des deux espèces d’Acacia par rapport à celle des plantes des autres traitements. L’expérience avec A. nilotica a été faite dans deux types de sol non stériles. Nous avons observé que les plants poussant dans le sol de Bel Air étaient plus nodulés et mieux développés que ceux poussant dans le sol de Sangalkam. Cependant, aucune différence significative entre les deux sols n’a été mise en évidence en termes d’effet des différentes méthodologies d’inoculation sur la nodulation et la croissance des plantes. Il a aussi été démontré l’existence d’une interaction entre les provenances d’A. senegal et d’A. nilotica et l’effet de l’inoculation avec rhizobium. C’est ainsi que les provenances Bel Air d’A. senegal, Dahra et RIM d’A. nilotica ont le mieux poussé parmi les différentes provenances testées. L’ensemble de ces résultats suggèrent: (1) il devrait être possible d’améliorer la croissance et la production d’A. senegal et d’A. nilotica par une sélection des deux partenaires symbiotiques; (2) Les jeunes plantules d’A. senegal et d’A. nilotica produites en pépinière devraient être inoculées juste après le semis avec des billes d’alginate dissoutes contenant un cocktail de souches sélectionnées.@@@Acacia nilotica

Under nursery conditions, mycorrhizal inoculation improved growth of seedlings. Root and shoot dry weights were higher in mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal plants. The concentration of P, K, Cu, Zn and Na was significantly higher in AM inoculated seedlings than in non-inoculated seedlings. Mycorrhization led to decrease in alkalinity of the rhizosphere soil from pH 8.5 to 7.4. Under nursery conditions, the degree of mycorrhizal dependency increased with age of C. siamea seedling. On transplantation to the field, the survival rate of mycorrhizal seedlings (75%–90%) was higher than that of non-mycorrhizal seedlings (40%). Besides better survival rate, AM inoculation improved the growth performance of seedlings in terms of height and stem diameter. Among the two AM fungi used, the efficiency of Glomus macrocarpum was higher than that of G. fasciculatum under both nursery and field conditions.@@@AM fungi

Karst.) container seedlings were planted in a controlled environment providing an air temperature of ∼22 °C and soil temperature of 9 ± 1 or 18 ± 1 °C. At planting the root plugs were either frozen or had been thawing for 4 days at 9 °C. During a 5-week growing period, in both cold and warm soil the root growth and height growth were less in frozen-planted seedlings than in thawed seedlings. In addition, frozen-planting delayed bud burst and increased mortality. Soil temperature, however, had no effect on bud burst or mortality. Low soil temperature retarded root growth of seedlings thawed before planting but resulted in both retarded root growth and height growth if root plugs were frozen when planted. These results indicate that planting Norway spruce seedlings with frozen root plugs constitutes a considerable risk for successful forest regeneration at soil temperatures normally prevailing in Fennoscandia in spring or early summer especially if the soil is dry at the time of the planting.@@@Frozen-planting

First, seedlings of A. sachalinensis on skid trails, soil mounds, soil pits, and undisturbed soil were counted, and their areas were measured. Most seedlings were found on skid trails. Seedling densities of A. sachalinensis on sites with soil disturbance, with the exception of soil pits, were significantly greater than that on undisturbed soil. Second, densities of Sasa senanensis, heights of S. senanensis, and seedling densities of A. sachalinensis on skid trails and undisturbed soil in both a closed-canopy stand and in a canopy gap were compared. Seedling density of A. sachalinensis on skid trails in the closed-canopy stand was significantly greater than that in the canopy gap. Average density and average height of S. senanensis, which is known to interfere with regeneration of many woody species, were significantly greater on skid trails and undisturbed soil in the canopy gap than those in the closed-canopy stand. It could be concluded from this study that both crown closure and soil disturbance are essential for natural regeneration of A. sachalinensis on soil in sub-boreal forests.@@@Abies sachalinensis

Phenotypic variation of fruit traits from 100 trees in southeast Nigeria@@@@@@Received: 17 May 2005 Revised: 16 December 2003 Issue Date: March 2005@@@A participatory approach to tree domestication is being pioneered by ICRAF and international partners in Cameroon and Nigeria. The domestication of Dacryodes edulis offers opportunities to improve the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and to diversify farming systems, such as cocoa farms. The trees produce marketable fruits as well as shade for cocoa and coffee. Twenty-four ripe fruits were collected from each of 100 D. edulis trees in Mgbuisi, southeast Nigeria by subsistence farmers. There was continuous and significant tree-to-tree variation in fruit mass (10.2±0.5–71.4±1.3 g), flesh mass (6.8±0.3– 62.2±1.2 g) and kernel mass (1.3±0.5–15.1±0.4 g). Mean fruit mass did not differ significantly between different land uses. Flesh mass:kernel mass ratio varied from 0.79 to 29.0. Two trees had fruits without kernels. There was also continuous and significant tree-to-tree variation in fruit length (39.0±0.6– 95.1±1.2 mm), fruit width (21.82±0.16–43.75±0.33 mm) and flesh thickness (1.82±0.1–6.39± 0.1 mm). Fruit length:width ratio varied from 1.35 to 3.18. Cooked fruits varied in taste with only 14% of trees getting the highest score. Similarly, fruits varied in oiliness with only 3% of trees getting the highest score. Thirteen skin colours were recorded, with the most common being dark blue (31%), greyish violet (29%) and deep blue (9%). Ninety-nine percent of the trees had been planted, with 57% in homegardens, 22% in crop fields, 17% in fallow land and 4% in cocoa. Tree height ranged from 4 to 22m, and DBH from 9.55 to 63.65 cm. Tree age ranged from 5 to 64 years. Farmers reported first fruiting from age 3 up to 22 years (average of 9.4 years). Most trees originated from seeds bought in markets (63%). Market prices of fruits from different trees, ranged from 2 to 12 fruits for 10 Naira (US0.07). These quantitative results will help in the identification of elite trees of D. edulis for cultivar development through clonal propagation.@@@African pear

"190","Growth performance and management of a mixed rainforest tree plantation@@@@@@Issue Date: March 2005@@@Monoculture plantations of Pinus, Eucalyptus and Acacia have beenestablished on rainforest lands throughout the world. However, this type of reforestation generally supplies low quality timber and contributes to landscape simplification. Alternatives to exotic monoculture plantations are now beginning to gain momentum with farmers and landholders attempting to establish a variety of rainforest trees in small plantations. When compared to the well studied commercial species, knowledge concerning the growth and management of many of these rainforest species is in its infancy. To help expand this limited knowledge base an experimental plantation of 16 rainforest tree species in a randomised design was established near Mt. Mee, in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Changes in growth, form (based on stem straightness, branch size and branchiness), crown diameters and leaf area of each species were examined over 5 years. Patterns of height growth were also measured monthly for 31 months. Species in this trial could be separated into three groups based on their overall growth after 5 years and their growth patterns. Early successional status, low timber density, high maximum photosynthetic rates and large total leaf areas were generally correlated to rapid height growth. Several species (including Araucaria cunninghamii, Elaeocarpus grandis, Flindersia brayleyana, Grevillea robusta and Khaya nyasica) had above average form and growth, while all species in the trial had considerable potential to have increased productivity through tree selection. As canopy closure occurred at the site between years four and five, growth increments declined. To reduce stand competition a number of different thinning techniques could be employed. However, simple geometric or productivity based thinnings appear to be inappropriate management techniques for this mixed species stand as they would either remove many of the best performing trees or nearly half the species in the trial. Alternatively, a form based thinning would maintain the site’s diversity, increase the average form of the plantation and provide some productivity benefits.@@@Australia

Reforestation of Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems is challenging as a result of harsh environmental conditions and historical human exploitation leading to degradation. New techniques have to be developed in order to increase survivorship and growth that integrates nursery and field treatments. A total of 60 treatments resulting from 12 site × 5 plant preparation techniques were tested. Plant preparation consists of mycorrhizing in nursery, extra fertilizing in nursery, planting in containers in the nursery, planting in the field with a polypropylene tube, and control plants (bred in plastic bags). Soil preparation consists of hole, subsoiling without amendment, subsoiling with composted organic amendment added in the surface or in the furrow of plantation and subsoiling with fresh organic amendment added in the surface or in the furrow of plantation. Each one of these treatments was tested with a hydrophilic acrylic copolymer and without it. Survivorship was very high (0.91) given the prevailing environmental conditions. Subsoiling promoted higher survival than holes, and plants bred in containers had lower levels of survivorship than control ones. Protecting seedlings with polypropylene tubes had no effect on survivorship. The most effective treatment for promoting growth was organic amendment, the effect of which increased until the fourth year. Protection with tubes was very effective in increasing height, although only in the short-term. Subsoiling also promoted faster growth than holes, although the effect was less noticeable after 3 years and was, in any case, less effective than organic amendment. Other treatments promoting faster growth were the use of fresh organic waste as opposed to composted waste and its incorporation in the plantation furrow rather than as a layer on the surface. The addition of hydrophilic acrylic copolymer reduced growth during the first months of the reforestation. The fertilization of plants in the nursery and inoculation with spores of mycorhyzal fungi did not improve seedling growth. Plants bred in containers performed worse than control plants bred in individual plastic bags. The findings suggests the importance of nutrient supply in semiarid environments, an aspect that has been previously neglected in favor of water supply. Organic amendments reinforce both and can be recommended as long as adequate environmental controls are in place.@@@Hole

With the aim to recommend the use Schinus and Rapanea in gallery forest restoration programs, we conducted an experiment with the objective to analyze the capacity of these two pioneer trees to tolerate soil flooding, mainly by accessing the effects of flooding on leaf gas exchange, growth and dry matter partitioning. Seedling survival throughout the 56-day flooding period were 100 and 90% for Schinus and Rapanea, respectively. The mean values of stomatal conductance (gs ) and net photosynthesis (A) observed in the control seedlings were, respectively, 0.4 mol m−2s−1 and 14 mmolm−2s−1, for Schinus, and 0.5 mol m−2s−1 and 14 mmolm−2s−1, for Rapanea. On day 20 flooding reduced gs and A by 36 and 29% in Schinus, and 81 and 61% in Rapanea. At the end of the experiment, significant decreases were also observed for root and whole plant biomass, in both species. Based on the results, we concluded that seedlings of Schinus and Rapanea can survive and grow throughout a medium period of soil waterlogging, in spite of the alterations observed in their physiological behavior, such as the decreases in stomatal conductance and in whole plant biomass.@@@Brazilian Atlantic rainforest

To assess photosynthetic responses to drought treatment, seedlings of 12 open-pollinated families of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) differing in their growth performance were grown in a controlled environment. Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters as well as shoot xylem water potential (WP) were measured for 21 successive days after watering was stopped. Net photosynthesis decreased as stomatal conductance decreased. Net photosynthesis was not affected by drought until WP reached −2.0 MPa when stomata were closed. Initial fluorescence (F and basic fluorescence after induction (F00) were not affected by drought. A progressive decrease in maximal (Fm) and variable fluorescences (Fv), maximum photosystem II (PS II) efficiency (Fv = Fm), effective quantum yield of PS II (FII), photochemical efficiency of open PS II (Fp), and photochemical quenching (qP) was observed at WP < - 1.0 MPa, whereas non-photochemical quenching (qN) remained high throughout the drought treatment. White spruce families with inferior growth performance showed higher values of Fm, Fv, Fv = Fm, Fp, and qN at WP< - 2.0MPa. The results indicated that chlorophyll fluorescence variables can be used as drought markers in relation to present or predicted climate conditions. These could be used for selecting planting stock adapted to drought periods or dry environments. These markers showed that slow-growing genotypes are better adapted to drought conditions than intermediate or fast-growing genotypes in present and predicted drought conditions.@@@Chlorophyll fluorescence

Studies investigated the effects on rooting of stem cuttings of growth regulators with sucrose and fungicide (0%, 0.2% p-HBA + 5% sucrose + 5% captan, and IBA concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.0% plus each containing, 0.2% p-HBA + 5% sucrose + 5% captan). Cuttings were collected at two times of the year (February and July) from two types of stock plant (seedling and mature trees) and from two positions within the shoots (lower and upper nodes). Cuttings collected in February were leafless, while those collected in July had about 80 cm2 leaf areas. These cuttings were then set under a mist unit. Percentage rooting and primary root number differed significantly between treated and untreated cuttings. Treatment of cuttings with chemical formulations of 0.4% IBA + 0.2% p-HBA + 5% sucrose + 5% captan maximized rooting (82.0%), while, survival (80%) and primary root number (14.7) were greatest with: (i) 0.6% IBA + 0.2% p-HBA + 5% sucrose + 5% captain and (ii) 0.8% IBA + 0.2% p-HBA + 5% sucrose + 5% captan, respectively. Rooting success and root number were better in propagules set in February rather than in July. Cuttings from seedlings rooted better, with more roots ensuring better survival, than cuttings from mature trees (12–13-years-old). In cuttings from seedlings, those cuttings collected from the lower part of the shoots had greater percentage rooting and primary root number than those from the upper part. Maximum root regeneration (100%), roots number (19.0), and survival (98.5%) were achieved when the time of collection (February) and shoot position were optimized. Rooting was best when cuttings had higher levels of sugar, total carbohydrate and peroxidase enzyme activity, and low N.@@@Indole-3-butyric acid

Pro-embryo masses (PEMs) were induced on immature zygotic embryos applied to medium supplemented with 2.3 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The established PEMs were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404/p35S GUS INT/pCAMBIA 1301 strain. Transformants were selected on hygromycin (HYG) 94 μM-supplemented medium. Viable embryos constituted 13% of those selected on HYG during 4 months. Expression of β-glucuronidase at 4 months following co-cultivation confirmed transformation in 5.8% embryos selected on HYG.

Don. Survival and third-year tree height were examined in relation to (a) initial diameter, (b) initial height, (c) initial diameter squared, (d) bulk index (diameter squared × height), and (e) sturdiness index (height/diameter). Of the five attributes examined, initial diameter was correlated with survival on two sites, while height and sturdiness index were not correlated with survival. Cutting morphology was more consistently correlated with growth than with survival. On all sites, growth of cuttings after outplanting was positively related to size (e.g., diameter, height, bulk-index). Results from these trials suggest good performance of rooted fascicle cuttings can be expected when stem diameters (at the soil surface) range from 8 to 10 mm and heights range from 25 to 40 cm.@@@Clone

Tank studies have indicated substantial intraspecific variation in salt tolerance within baldcypress populations, but only one field study has been conducted and it used a limited seed source. The major objective of this project was to expand the collection range of baldcypress across the southeastern United States and determine if there are baldcypress populations that can survive and grow in saltwater damaged areas. Seeds were collected in 1996 from eight estuarine areas (James River = VA; Cape Fear River = NC; Winyah Bay = SC; Ogeechee River = GA; Ochlockonee River = FL; Mobile Bay = AL; Biloxi River=MS; Chalmette = LA). Seeds were stratified and planted, and seedlings were grown for 2 years before planting in two abandoned ricefields on Hobcaw Barony near Georgetown, South Carolina in 1999. Salinity levels reached 18.5ppt during 2001 at the peak of the worst drought on record. By 2002, the only seedlings surviving were those from LA, AL, and FL. After 5 years in the field, LA seedlings were the best performers with a mortality rate of only 27%. More detailed analyses of the biologic and genetic characteristics of trees growing in the LA site need to be completed to determine if they represent a source of baldcypress seed possessing greater tolerance to saline conditions. If so, seeds need to be collected and nurseries established to grow seedlings to help restore degraded wetland swamp areas along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.@@@Baldcypress

Results indicate that the constant-parameter transition probabilities for all species in the mixed uneven-aged forest could be classified into three groups based on the mean upgrowth probabilities of each species. Constant-parameter transition probabilities of all species in each diameter class fluctuate within a narrow range except for diameter classes below 8 cm and greater than 60 cm. Variable-parameter transition probabilities were found to be a function of residual basal area for small diameter classes. For large trees, transition probabilities are not affected by the residual basal area. Based on this study, variable-parameter transition probabilities for large diameter trees can be replaced with constant-parameter transition probabilities. In addition, a new ingrowth model was developed and the new ingrowth model was shown to perform better than existing ingrowth model used in the region.@@@Growth and yield

The model takes into account four variables including residual basal area (RBA), the diameter of the largest tree, harvest cycle and a constant representing the ratio of the number of trees in a given diameter class to those in the next larger diameter class (‘q’). According to model simulations, under the objective of maximizing net revenue, the optimal harvesting strategy is defined when the residual basal area equals to 19 m2 ha−1, the diameter of the largest tree equals to 44 cm, q 1.3 and the harvest cycle equals to 20 years. If the objective is to maximize the total volume yield, the optimal harvesting strategy is defined when RBA equals to 13 m2 ha−1, the diameter of the largest tree equals to 36 cm and the constant ‘q’ equals to 1.9 and the harvest cycle equals to 15 years.@@@Broad-leaved mixed-species stands

Intercropping of Eucalyptus camaldulensis with rice and beans was studied to compare yields of intercropping and monocultures over 2 years. In the first year, no differences were found in the productivity between the intercropped and monoculture systems of E. camaldulensis, rice and beans in both seasons. In the second year, E. camaldulensis in monoculture showed the lowest productivity. If compared with E. camaldulensis intercropped with agricultural crops, during the rainy season, beans intercropped with E. camaldulensis showed similar productivity when compared to monoculture. In the dry season, the productivity of beans in monoculture was higher than intercropping. In the second year, rice productivity was very low for both systems due to the lack of precipitation during the fructification phase. The equivalence area index (EAI) confirmed the advantages of the intercropping system over the monoculture system for E. camaldulensis and beans and rice, at least in the first 2 years.@@@Effective productivity

The Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. pendula Roth studied included intact trees, trees that had been coppiced 8 years earlier, trees coppiced at the beginning of the experimental season, and birches that had been coppiced twice, 8 years earlier and at the beginning of the experimental season. Carbohydrate accumulation differed between 8 years earlier coppiced and intact trees. Recent coppicing clearly decreased the starch and sugar concentrations of the roots, which were often highest in the thin roots. The concentrations of these compounds in the stumps were always low, although the carbohydrate concentrations of stumps, in particular, correlated with shoot regeneration capacity. Starch was the most labile of the carbohydrates measured and most clearly reacted to coppicing. Differences in starch- and sugar-reserve dynamics indicate a difference between these birch species in the use and replenishing of root and stump reserves. This information may also be of help when the effects of other stresses, for example, severe animal damage or burning, on the regrowth of young birch stands are estimated.@@@Betula pendula

We examined the influence of harvesting practices, tree size, and site conditions on stump sprouting in eight pondcypress (Taxodium distichum var. nutans (Ait.) Sweet) wetlands in Florida, USA. Stumps were cut at three heights: 20 cm below high water level, at high water, and 40 cm above high water. Half of each site was harvested using a sawhead feller and the other half using shearhead. We monitored sprouting for 2 years post-harvest. Stump height affected first year sprouting, but the effect disappeared during year 2. Felling equipment did not affect sprouting; however, the shearhead caused greater stump damage. Sprouting declined with increasing parent tree size; percentage of stumps with sprouts after 2 years was 68% for trees 10–14 cm dbh and 28% for trees 20–24 cm dbh. Stump sprouting ranged among sites from 23 to 54% after 2 years. Results indicate that sprouting may be an important, but inadequate, form of regeneration. At sites with short hydroperiods, dense understories, and/or predominance of trees greater than 20 cm dbh, reduced sprouting may occur, and planting seedlings may be beneficial.@@@Forest management

Juvenile diameter distributions were studied to gain insight into the effects of various stand-level factors. Results show that diameter distributions in juvenile loblolly pine stands can be successfully characterized with the two-parameter Weibull function. Repeated measures analysis detected significant planting density, age, and age by planting density interaction effects for the scale and shape parameter estimates from the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Using parameter recovery techniques, estimated diameter distributions were derived from easily attainable stand-level characteristics (i.e. basal area per hectare, planting density, age, and quadratic mean diameter). A thorough understanding of juvenile diameter distributions should prove especially useful for operational planning of stands on short rotations that require estimates of productivity at early ages.@@@Growth and yield

Large and small grades were top and/or root pruned and then outplanted on two sites in the lower Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. Seedling shoots were pruned to 50% of tree height, a 5 cm stump, or no pruning. Seedling roots were pruned to a 15 cm length or left unpruned. Site affected survival but not growth. Smaller, top pruned seedlings performed worse on one site, probably due to greater weed competition. Large seedlings increased survival and growth which increased 3 year average plot volumes by 89%. Top pruning stimulated height growth, but reduced diameter growth and decreased third year seedling volumes. Root pruning did not affect seedling growth. Diameter growth may better indicate treatment impact that height, which has been most commonly used in previous studies.@@@Root pruning

The following hypothesis was presented: P. maximinoi and L. macrophylla canopy facilitate the establishment of Quercus germana, Q. xalapensis, and Magnolia dealbata. After one year, the survival of seedlings and the growth rate in height and basal diameter were significantly different between treatments and species (p < 0.05). The results suggest a facilitation establishment of Magnolia dealbata under the canopy of Pinus and Liquidambar, whereas the tolerance was observed for Quercus germana and Q. xalapensis.

Seasonal and between-treatment variations on water relations, gas exchange parameters, growth and nutrient status were analyzed. Water potential (Ψ) was related to climatic conditions. Thus, the frequent rain storms during the summer allow seedlings to maintain relatively high Ψ values, joined to moderate photosynthetic activity. Differences on Ψ, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance due to irrigation were shown at the onset and end of growth, related with lower water availability. Fertilization had a greater effect on growth than irrigation. Both fertilization and irrigation positively affected the relative increment on leaf nutrient concentration at the end of the second year. The results indicate that water availability was not a limited factor, thus irrigation is not justified; while fertilization improve growth.@@@Climatic conditions

An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the growth of dipterocarp species in peat soils. Seedlings of Shorea pinanga were inoculated with spores of two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Pisolithus arhizus and Scleroderma sp. were grown in pots containing sterilized peat soil for 7 months. The percentage of ectomycorrhizal colonization on S. pinanga exceeded 86%. Colonization of S. pinanga roots by ectomycorrhizal fungi resulted in increased shoot height, stem diameter, number of leaves, and shoot fresh and dry weight. Survival rates of S. pinanga were greater for inoculated seedlings than control seedlings. These results suggest that inoculation of ectomycorrhizal fungi can improve the early growth of S. pinanga grown in tropical forests and that this technique will accelerate the rehabilitation of degraded dipterocarp forests.@@@Dipterocarpaceae

Growth rates of coppiced material are rapid in most situations, but stem/wood quality is a frequent concern. We compared coppiced teak plantations to paired seed-origin plantations, at ages 3, 8, and 13 years, on Forest State Corporation managed land located in Java, Indonesia. Teak trees were evaluated for height, diameter, lower-bole straightness, and presence of disease in both plantation types and at three ages. Mean height and diameter of trees in coppiced plantations were both significantly greater than that in their paired seed-origin plantations at all three ages. Furthermore, heights and diameters in coppiced plantations were higher than expected based on established growth tables for Java. Coppiced plantations were less symptomatic of disease than seed-origin plantations, which promises better wood production and quality. Lower-bole stems in coppiced plantations developed less straight than those in seed-origin plantations, but these deviations faded with time and will likely become insignificant within a 60-year rotation. Based on these results from existing coppiced plantations in Java, coppiced plantations can make a major contribution to teak production in Indonesia.@@@Neotermes tectonae

Three patterns of response to treatments were observed among the most abundant commercial tree species. (1) Shade-intolerant species regenerated mostly from seed and had the highest survival and growth rates following high-intensity burns. (2) Shade-tolerant species were abundant in gap control and plant removal treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. (3) Individuals of root sprouting species were most abundant following plant removal and low-intensity burn treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. The wide variation in species’ responses to gap treatments found in this study not only reinforces the concept that species are distributed along a continuum of shade-tolerance levels, but that other aspects of species’ biology, such as seed dispersal type or sprouting behavior, further differentiate regeneration strategies. The variety of regeneration strategies found among the species at this forest site will require a flexible management scheme that mixes more intensive silvicultural treatments such as prescribed burning with less intensive treatments.@@@Disturbance intensity

EP is defined in terms of three environmental impact categories: (1) carbon sequestration (2) groundwater recharge and (3) nitrate leaching. The core of the sDSS is a raster based geographical database which allows for queries addressing 14 types of questions on where, how and how long to afforest in order to reach a desired EP or change in EP due to afforestation of the agricultural land. First the study area is differentiated according to the site conditions (based on soil texture, soil drainage, initial land use, yearly average precipitation, and yearly average N deposition. Then the EP for every site class is computed as a function of time using the VSAM metamodel. VSAM results from a conceptual simplification of an existing mechanistic point model, the forest process model SMART2. Input data for the metamodel are limited to the classified site conditions, the tree species used for afforestation, the afforestation strategy and the evaluation time. Besides limiting the data requirements, the metamodel approach allows for rapid and flexible computations on large numbers of pixel classes. Finally, depending on the type of question, the sDSS creates georeferenced outputs based on SQL-type spatial or attribute queries and more advanced multiple goal programming techniques.@@@Afforestation

Seven site preparation treatments including raking (R), with sub-soiling (RS), disc harrowing (RD), tine ploughing (RT) and their combinations (RSD), (RDT) and (RSDT) were compared for the establishment of black pine (Pinus nigra Arn) in an oak coppice site, of conglomerate parent material at Anthrakia, northern Greece. The randomised blocks trial of three replications and 110 trees per treatment, half of which were fertilised with 150 g NPK per plant, was assessed at the age of 15 years for diameter, dominant tree height and survival. There was no significant difference between the treatments in any of the traits examined, nor did the fertilisation had any effect. Only the fertiliser × treatment interaction was found significant at p<0.001 for dominant height, accounting for 37% of the observed variation in this trait. The lack of response to site preparation treatments may be attributed to the hard Bt3 clay horizon, extending beyond cultivation depth (50 cm), that prevents the roots penetration into deeper moist soil layers. The F × T interaction, where the combination of (RSDT) treatment and fertiliser was found to accelerate tree height growth in relation to the same treatment without fertiliser, indicates that thorough soil cultivation is needed for fertilisation to be effective in such sites.@@@Fertilisation

These relationships were also studied on seedlings of different stock types (grown in different container types). Measurements with root pressure probes were taken at various times after germination, under applied hydrostatic pressure and non-limiting soil moisture. Different N-treatments and stock types were used solely to produce seedling of different sizes, especially root system sizes. Specific root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) typically declined with an increasing root system size and correlations between Lpr and the root system size attributes were often negative. The flow of water through the root system correlated well with root system size attributes only in young (3–4 month old) seedlings but the correlations were inconsistent among different N treatments and stock types. Neither the root system surface area nor dry weight reliably reflected its ability to absorb and conduct water. Generally, the amount of water delivered through the root system and available for transpiration per unit or leaf surface area or unit of leaf dry weight correlated poorly or negatively with the root system size. Practical and scientific implications of the findings are discussed.@@@Planting stock quality

Evaluation of how seed source affects root system responses to soil conditions will allow seed sources to be matched to planting conditions. The root growth and hydraulic conductivity of three sources each of shortleaf, loblolly and longleaf pine seedlings were evaluated for 28 days in a seedling growth system that simulated the planting environment. Across species, an increase in root-zone temperature alleviated limitations to root growth caused by water stress. In the coldest temperature, longleaf pine maintained a higher hydraulic conductivity compared to shortleaf and loblolly pine. Without water limitation, the root growth and hydraulic conductivity of shortleaf and loblolly pine were superior to that of longleaf pine, but as water availability decreased, the root growth of longleaf pine surpassed that of loblolly pine. Hydraulic conductivities of the seed sources differed, and differences were attributed to either new root growth, or an increase in the efficiency of the root system to transport water.@@@Pinus echinata

While height and root-collar diameter are the most common traits evaluated during seedling quality assessment, above-ground morphology is not always an accurate predictor of performance after outplanting. Root system morphology and physiological status may provide a more accurate indication of seedling potential. However, relatively few studies have attempted to quantitatively assess root system quality in relation to outplanting success. Large root volume, high root fibrosity, and an increased number of first-order lateral roots have shown some correlation to improved field performance. Physiological seedling quality assessment is commonly practiced through evaluation of root growth potential. Other tests, such as root electrolyte leakage, have also shown some potential as measures of seedling physiological quality. This review identifies current methods of assessing seedling root system quality and discusses potential shortcomings of these methods. An increased understanding of the suitability of current tests, coupled with the development of new tests and multiple parameter relationships, may foster the development of species and site-specific targets for seedling root system quality assessment. The production of seedlings with root systems that meet high morphological and physiological standards better enables seedlings to rapidly establish and thrive upon outplanting.@@@Electrolyte leakage

"217","Fertilizer-induced Changes in Rhizosphere Electrical Conductivity: Relation to Forest Tree Seedling Root System Growth and Function@@@@@@Received: 01 July 2004 Accepted: 19 April 2005 Issue Date: September 2005@@@Fertilization is standard practice in forest tree seedling nursery culture. Additionally, fertilization at outplanting has potential to facilitate nutrient uptake and reduce transplant shock. Fertilization, however, may dramatically alter rhizosphere chemical properties such as pH, ion availability, and electrical conductivity (EC). These changes may inhibit root system growth and function by reducing soil osmotic potential and creating specific ion toxicities. The risk of root damage associated with high EC levels appears to be dependent on species, age of root system, and soil moisture availability. Root inhibition in container nursery culture of conifers is likely to occur above 2.5 dS m−1, though threshold EC levels for bareroot culture and field plantings are largely unavailable. Fertilization at outplanting has the added risk that drought conditions may prevent leaching of excess fertilizer salts, which can increase rhizosphere EC beyond safe levels and ultimately impair root uptake of water or nutrients. For fertilization programs to be successful, a critical threshold balance must be maintained between optimizing seedling nutrient availability in the rhizosphere, while minimizing potential for root damage. Future research is needed to identify optimal EC levels for a range of species across all stages of the reforestation process, from nursery culture through plantation establishment.@@@Controlled-release fertilizer

Franco) seedling stocktypes were compared during the first growing season after outplanting. The study was installed in raised beds with ideal environmental conditions and at a field reforestation site. Survival at both sites was 98% and did not differ between stocktypes. Seedlings were excavated in spring (5, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after planting) and in fall (35, 40, and 45 weeks after planting). In spring, container seedlings had more numbers of new roots and greater new root and shoot biomass than bareroot seedlings at both sites. In fall, bareroot seedlings consistently averaged more new root growth (though nonsignificant) than container seedlings suggesting that stocktype differences may not continue long-term. Container seedlings had significantly greater water percent than bareroot seedlings at the field site (all sample dates) and the raised bed site (weeks 5, 8, and 40 only). Regardless of environmental conditions or season, seedlings at both sites maintained water percent between 60 and 70% of fresh weight. Seedlings grown in the raised beds had much greater growth than those grown in the field. However, relative growth patterns for the two stocktypes were very similar on each site. The data generated establish baseline differences between stocktypes for root initiation, growth, and allometry during the first year after planting. Challenges associated with root development research are discussed.@@@Biomass allocation

This was accomplished for northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Quercus alba L.), and black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh) seedlings graded into four Rv categories at establishment. Field survival was high (85–97%) for all species. Initial diameter, height, fresh mass, and Rv provided similar predictive ability of second-year field response for absolute height (R2 = 0.59–0.77) and diameter (R2 = 0.50–0.73) for both oak species. Initial seedling Rv was a better predictor of field response than FOLR for both oak species, though not for cherry. Multiple-variable models accounted for a greater proportion of the total variation in seedling field height and diameter than did single-variable equations. The high R2 (up to 0.95) of regression models suggests field performance of these species can be reliably predicted and confirms the importance of initial seedling morphology in dictating early plantation performance.@@@Bareroot seedlings

"220","Root-freezing damage in the containerized nursery: impact on plantation sites – A review@@@@@@Received: 21 June 2004 Accepted: 23 February 2005 Issue Date: September 2005@@@Root-freezing damage frequently occurs in forest nurseries operating in cold climates. This type of damage arises because: (i) environmental cues for root cold acclimation differ from those for shoot acclimation; (ii) the root growing season is longer than shoot growing season; (iii) strong differences in root cold tolerance exist among species and provenances; (iv) root tissues are less frost tolerant than those of shoots, and young roots are less tolerant than mature ones; and (v) cultural practices can adversely affect root cold hardiness. To quantify root-freezing damage, different techniques have been tested. Electrolyte leakage is the most widely used and provides a good correlation with survival and regrowth. The impact of root-freezing damage on seedling performance has been studied under controlled and field conditions. Seedlings with root-freezing damage showed a reduction in survival and growth. Survival was reduced when root-freezing damage are severe. Growth reduction is mainly explained by a reduction in water and nitrogen uptake. The identification of a threshold in root-freezing damage below which survival and regrowth would not be affected should be determined for species most commonly used in reforestation.@@@Conifer

"221","Root diseases in bareroot and container nurseries of the Pacific Northwest: epidemiology, management, and effects on outplanting performance@@@@@@Received: 21 June 2004 Accepted: 23 March 2005 Issue Date: September 2005@@@In forest and conservation nurseries in the Pacific Northwest USA, seedling production can be limited by root diseases caused by fungi in the genera Fusarium Link:Fr., Cylindrocarpon Wollenw., Phytophthora de Barry, and Pythium Pringsh. Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and Pythium are the most ubiquitous, whereas incidence of Phytophthora is mostly associated with coastal bareroot nurseries. All of these root pathogens are encouraged by water saturated soils or media. Seedlings infected with Fusarium, Phytophthora, or Pythium often appear chlorotic or necrotic with extensive root decay. Cylindrocarpon often causes serious root decay without shoot symptoms. The best approach to mitigate losses from these diseases is to use a holistic integrated pest management program. This program should combine chemical controls with cultural practices, particularly those that increase soil permeability and drainage and reduce potential sources of inoculum, especially by disinfesting seeds and containers reused for crops. In general, we found that seedlings meeting nursery specifications for outplanting on forest soil (proper height, root collar diameter, healthy shoot color, lack of disease symptoms) but having these disease organisms on their root systems perform as well as non-infected seedlings.@@@Cylindrocarpon

Herbert Stone nursery@@@@@@Received: 21 June 2004 Accepted: 25 July 2005 Issue Date: September 2005@@@Bareroot nursery practices that maximize root development and growth have been studied and documented over a number of years. Each nursery, however, has its own unique combination of climate, soils, species, and stocktypes for which site specific cultural practices are necessary. J. Herbert Stone Nursery, a USDA Forest Service nursery, located in Central Point, OR, has completed a variety of production trials to adapt general cultural practices to its site. These trials resulted in changes which include: developing a strategy to maintain a high soil porosity through the application of organic matter and tillage measures; sowing seed earlier in the winter for 1 + 0 stocktypes; lowering seedbed densities from 267 seedlings/m2 (25 seedlings/ft2) to between 161 and 195 seedlings/m2 (15 and 18 seedlings/ft2); transplanting seedlings in early fall instead of spring; and developing a miniplug + 1 stocktype.@@@Pinus ponderosa

That ectomycorrhizae can assist the plant partner in absorbing mineral nutrients has long been established. However, the impact of mycorrhizae on pathways available for soil nutrients to enter the root system is not clear. In particular, the impact of the fungal mantle, which surrounds the root tips, is most critical. In the present study, we assessed the permeability of the Pinus banksiana/Hebeloma cylindrosporum fungal mantle to both berberine and radioactive sulfate ions. It was found that the fungal mantle was completely impermeable to tracer dye. To test the permeability to sulfate ions, a novel technique called the internal perfusion technique was employed. By this method, permeability can be assessed. The fungal mantle proved to be impermeable to sulfate over a 24-hour exposure period. Based on recent findings pertaining to root anatomy, this result suggests that the plant may be highly dependent on the fungus to supply mineral nutrients as there is little plant tissue capable of nutrient absorption outside the fungal mantle.@@@Anatomy

"227","Importance of root growth in overcoming planting stress@@@@@@Received: 21 June 2004 Accepted: 21 December 2005 Issue Date: September 2005@@@Root growth is critical to the establishment of planted seedlings. Seedlings can undergo stress just after planting if root growth is not sufficient to couple the seedling to available soil water. Stress occurs when a newly planted seedling’s root system can not supply enough water to transpiring needles to maintain a proper water balance and ensure survival. Thus, a newly planted seedling’s ability to overcome planting stress is affected by its root system size and distribution, root–soil contact, and root hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes how factors of root growth and water status of newly planted seedlings are important in overcoming the phenomenon of planting stress which then allows a newly planted seedling to enter the establishment phase of development.@@@Forest regeneration

At the end of the production period, significant differences were found in morphological responses among the seedlings to the various container characteristics. Seedlings grown in containers that permitted lateral air puning presented less growth and lower biomass production. However, root deformations were more frequent and severe in plants produced in closed-wall containers. Field performance was likewise mainly affected by container type and plant growth rate, as faster grown plants showed more problems of stability than plants with a balanced root and stem development.@@@Root architecture

Subsequently, three harvesting regimes for the collection of single node stem cuttings were imposed: (1) once – in March (H 1), (2) twice – in March and September (H 2) and (3) three times in March, July and November (H 3). Cuttings were treated basally with either:- T 0 – control (6 h in water), T 1 – half the recommended dose of a mixture of IBA and thiamine (500 ppm IBA + 400 ppm thiamine) or T 2 – the full dose of the same mixture (1000 ppm IBA + 800 ppm thiamine). Cuttings receiving IBA + thiamine rooted significantly better than untreated cuttings, but even the best treatment only resulted in 38.3 ± 3.8% rooting. This treatment produced the greatest number of roots (5.2–12.1). The full dose treatment appears to have been supra-optimal. Rooting ability was also affected by the frequency of stockplant pruning, with cuttings from stockplants pruned twice per year having the greatest rooting percentage (27.8 ± 3.8%) and the most roots (9.2 ± 4.8). This bi-annual pruning (H 2) resulted in the greatest number of rooted propagules (2.6 and 4.2 times more than H 1 and H 3, respectively). There was a significant interaction between Treatment × Pruning frequency. Bi-annual hedging of teak stockplants is recommended for practical purposes, although further work is required to achieve commercially acceptable levels of rooting from coppiced tree stumps.@@@Coppice shoots

Influences of nursery, season (spring and autumn), host genus and plant part on those fungal assemblages have been also evaluated. Four nurseries were sampled in spring and three in autumn. Analysed material consisted of stems, roots and rhizosphere from five host species, Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris. A total of 581 isolates corresponding to 13 taxa were found in this study. Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum and Trichoderma viride were the most frequently isolated fungi. Number of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sampled parts. Multivariate Correspondence Analysis allowed the discrimination of samples in five groups based on nursery, season, host genus and plant part. Isolation frequencies of F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum were higher in the roots and in spring, whereas those of T. viride were higher in the rhizosphere and in autumn. A relationship was observed between presence of T. viride and absence of Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries. T. viride, could serve as a biological control agent against Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries.@@@Antagonistic fungi

All of the 17 indigenous species examined could grow in the mine spoil and the growth of a majority of them could be improved by amending the mine spoil with NPK fertilizer. Direct seeding showed greatest height of Zizyphus jujuba and Pongamia pinnata on flat surface, and of Azadirachta indica on slope. In terms of diameter, Syzygium cumini performed best on flat surface and Terminalia arjuna on slope. Total biomass in plantations of selected native tree species on mine spoil at 5-yr age varied from 7.2 to 74.7 t ha−1, being minimum for Shorea robusta and maximum for Dendrocalamus strictus. Total net production ranged from 3.5 (for Shorea robusta) to 32.0 t ha−1 yr−1 (for Dendrocalamus strictus), respectively. Microbial biomass in the redeveloping soil was lower compared to that in natural forest soil but immobilization of soil C in microbial biomass was greater in the mine spoil than in the natural forest. The study indicated that net primary production of the plantations was a function of the amount of foliage, soil C was a function of the amount of litter fall and biomass C was a function of soil C. Plantation of trees significantly accelerated the soil redevelopment process on the mine spoil.@@@Biomass

The findings show significant differences in these features, which indicates that variation in shoot anatomy can be used as a reliable indicator of juvenility/maturity in teak. The effect of age of donor plants and application of auxins on adventitious root formation in single noded leafy stem cuttings of teak was also investigated. Aging of donor trees suppressed rooting and sprouting of cuttings, but increased callus formation at the base of cuttings. Per cent rooting and per cent sprouting in cuttings decreased as age of donor plants increased from 2-months to 15-years and up to 30-years. IBA treatment promoted per cent rooting as well as per cent sprouting, NAA promoted only rooting and it suppressed sprouting. The effect of auxin treatment on rooting and sprouting of teak stem cuttings varied with the age of donor plants. Auxin and its concentration, which suppressed rooting and sprouting in cuttings of younger donor plants, actually promoted rooting when cuttings were taken from more mature donor plants. It appears that the auxin requirement for causing and promoting rooting in teak cuttings increased with increasing age of donor plants. The higher auxin requirement for causing and promoting rooting in cuttings of older trees may be due to a decrease in the content on endogenous auxins or decreased sensitivity of aging tissues to rooting promoters and /or accumulation of inhibitory substances which inhibit rooting.@@@Aging

Franco) seedlings were grown with conventional soluble fertilizer and supplemented with one of four slow-release fertilizers (SRF treatments) or unsupplemented (control treatment). Seedlings were outplanted to two sites in 1998. At the time of outplanting, SRF incorporated into the growing medium resulted in larger seedlings with higher foliar nutrient concentrations as compared to conventionally fertilized seedlings. After four growing seasons, SRF-amended seedlings at both sites had significantly greater height, basal stem diameter, and stem volume, with increases up to 19, 21, and 73%, respectively, as compared to conventionally fertilized seedlings. Additionally, three stock sizes were compared at one of the sites. Increasing stock size resulted in increased growth during the first two seasons, enabling larger stock to maintain their size advantage. Seedling responses to SRF are attributed to larger initial size, increased internal nutrient reserves at planting, and continued fertilization after planting.@@@Container production

In ‘hollong’ (Dipterocarpus macrocarpus Vesque), I address the following questions: (a) are seeds that germinate randomly distributed within a seed population, (b) are subpopulations of viable and non-viable seeds separable, (c) does seed size predict which seeds germinate and (d) does seed size predict time required for germination and seedling vigour? Two estimators of seed size, diameter and weight, demonstrated a significant positive linear relationship endorsing assumption that accumulation of mass increases with increase in diameter of seeds. A threshold for selection of potential seeds for germination could not be derived from diameter measurements since seeds in an entire range of diameter did or did not germinate. All seeds <11 g did not germinate, but this threshold lies at the far lower end of the weight range and allows rejection of only a few seeds and acceptance of many seeds that will not germinate. A risk of potential seeds being rejected or non-viable seeds being picked exists if selection was derived from either diameter or weight. However, viable seeds could be better predicted from a scatter-plot of diameter on x-axis and weight on y-axis. Seeds showed a fan-shaped scatter and those developing the lower blade of the fan did not germinate while those following the handle were successful. Hence, two subpopulations segregated, but with a fuzzy edge. Mean diameter and mean weight of germinated seeds were significantly greater than those of ungerminated seeds. Most ungerminated seeds were those that had relatively smaller weight compared to their diameter. Although some large diameter seeds with small weight did germinate, but failed to develop into seedlings. Germination time and seedling vigour parameters (height, leaf number and collar diameter) were correlated both with diameter and weight. However, weight appears to have mattered more than diameter in germination success and early seedling growth.@@@Germination time

To increase soil organic matter (OM), nurseries commonly grow a cover crop for 1 year after every 1–2 year of seedling production. Raising soil OM levels can also be achieved through addition of soil amendments. We studied the influence of chicken manure (CM) and composted leaf, tree, and lawn trimmings (Cp) on soil properties and morphology of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings. CM was applied at 725, 1450, or 2900 kg ha−1 (CM725, CM1450, and CM2900, respectively) and Cp was applied at 200 m3 ha−1. Addition of CM and Cp significantly raised soil OM levels and altered soil chemical properties compared to the control (Ctrl). Root-collar diameter increased with addition of CM1450, CM2900, or Cp compared to CM725 or Ctrl plots for northern red oak, but was largest in soils amended with CM2900 for green ash. Conversely, height was greatest with addition of CM725 for northern red oak, but green ash seedlings were shorter in Ctrl plots than in all amendments except for CM725. Root volume of green ash and northern red oak seedlings was positively influenced by addition of CM or Cp. Seedling responses to nursery soil amendments vary with different forms and amounts of OM. Benefits to seedling growth through application of appropriate materials in the proper balance can improve seedling morphological quality and positively influence soil chemical properties.@@@Chicken manure

Many governments, especially in developing countries, have prioritized CFM over traditional forest management systems. In Thailand, CFM is not recognized by the legal system; however, there are de facto CFM practices under common property resource regimes. CFM has in essence been practiced here for hundreds of years by local people, and represents an important aspect of Thai culture. This study aims at evaluating CFM in Thailand in the context of sustainable development. To meet the objective, the study gathered information through focus group discussions with various stakeholders: academics, Forest Department staff, and members of the Chang Tok Tay community forests. From the study, it emerged that forest resources are critical for the livelihoods and survival of rural people, and so they have protected forests to ensure sustainable livelihoods. This study identified that prospects for sustainable CFM in Thailand are bright because: (i) community members are highly motivated and are sufficiently interested to protect trees because they are well aware that their livelihoods are under threat from depleting forests; (ii) tradition and culture of rural people support their relation with nature; (iii) non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play a crucial role in local livelihoods for subsistence and necessitate protection of the forest watershed, which is vital to support their occupations; (iv) spiritual rituals such as those where Buddhist monks bind yellow cloth on trees play a vital role in protecting trees, something rare in other countries. The study further identified various hindrances to achieve sustainable CFM: (i) legal support for CFM is absent; (ii) the Royal Forest Department (RFD) cannot transfer appropriate technology to community people due to lack of legal support; (iii) scope for developing effective strategies for sustainable CFM by combining traditional knowledge with existing scientific knowledge is limited; (iv) a formal institutional arrangement for CFM does not exist; and (v) community members’ access to the hard technology of CFM is limited. Therefore, in addition to legalizing CFM, a formal institutional framework for elaboration, implementation and control of CFM is essential to achieve sustainable CFM in Thailand.@@@Community forest management

Each basidiospore inoculum originated from a mixed gall collection of aeciospores obtained from field-infected trees. Assessments at 4.5 months after inoculation showed that rust disease levels were high for every full-sib family and were typically above 90% for most full-sib families for both inocula. However, disease (% galled) for family E by A progeny, even at 9 months post inoculation, was lower, around 75%. A genetic model for interaction of two pairs of genes was proposed to explain the observed infection levels (% galled) in this diallel based on a gene-for-gene hypothesis. The putative genotypes of host parents and virulence compositions of mixed inocula were postulated. A bulk-segregant analysis approach based on phenotype (gall vs. no gall) was used to search for dominant molecular markers associated with the potential resistance genes in the host parents. A few candidate marker polymorphisms were observed between the gall vs. no gall bulks; however, none of the candidates appropriately co-segregated with phenotype when tested across the progeny set. An alternative model involving recessive resistance controlled by a single locus was also considered, but as with the two gene model, no markers to support the appropriateness of the recessive resistance model were observed.@@@Artificial inoculation

Nursery managers in the southern United States currently use many practices to control pests of southern pine seedlings. Over the last three decades, improvements in chemical, cultural, and biological pest control practices have increased seed efficiency (defined as the number of plantable seedlings produced divided by the number of pure live seed sown) and reduced the percentage of production costs associated with pest control. As crop values increase, the economic thresholds for applying control measures decrease. However, since the statistical power of most trials in bareroot nurseries is low, the likelihood of experiments that detect “real” treatment difference (e.g. those that consistently increase seed efficiency to the point where economic returns are affected) will be low. This paper describes some current practices in southern pine nurseries and provides some economic injury levels for various pest control treatments.@@@Insects

Nine years after drainage, the diameter, height, basal area, and volume growth of tamarack had increased by 2–5 times that on the control site. Black spruce growth on the drained site was 1.6–5 times that on the control. Tamarack average volume growth (1.20 m3 ha−1 year−1) on the drained site was superior to that of black spruce (0.21 m3 ha−1 year−1). In general for both species, there were no significant differences in growth between trees on the different ditch spacings. This result was attributed to the water table being low enough that adequate aeration zones existed across the strips between ditches on all spacings. Regeneration after treatment was greater on the drained than on the control plots, particularly in the disturbed areas near the ditches where new tamarack seedlings reached densities between 9400 and 12,000 stems ha−1. There was no relationship between increased tree growth and tree distance from the ditches for both species, probably because the water table had been lowered sufficiently so that inadequate substrate aeration was no longer a limiting factor.@@@Ditch spacing

The growth of mean stand trees of green ash and narrow-leaved ash were studied in 14 sites (a systematic sample of 0.03 ha circular plots). A total of 212 trees were cored and 11 cross-section samples were taken for stem analysis. The Mann-Whitney U-test showed statistically significant differences in radial growth between narrow-leaved and green ash at all sites. In green ash, the test revealed a statistically significant difference in the radial growth between the last 20-year-period and the preceding 20-year-period. Green ash are characterised by the fact that annual radial growth in the first 20–30 years is very high (above average), while after that it is consistently suppressed below average growth and amounts to only about 1.5 mm. The obtained results of faster growth and a low final growth value suggest that green ash should be managed with short rotations, since this important pioneer species is intended to improve the conditions in those sites where forest vegetation has regressed.@@@Green ash

In order to examine the feasibility of improving the resistance of poplar to insect pests by the introduction of a plant-derived amine-generating transgene, explants from the hybrid poplar clone ‘INRA 717 1B4’ (P. tremula ×P. albo) were transformed with a Camptotheca acuminata tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC, EC 4.1.1.28) cDNA driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. The enzyme TDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine, which, in addition to being a bioactive amine itself, is known to act as a precursor of various other indole derivatives. Putative transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR for the TDC1 gene sequence and by the expression analysis of the transgene mRNA and encoded protein. No visible phenotypic changes were associated with ectopic TDC1 expression. Chemical and radiotracer analyses of the transgenic plants revealed tryptamine accumulation as high as 4 mM in leaf tissue, and suggested that the tryptamine produced by ectopically expressed TDC was not further metabolized. Insect bioassays with the TDC transgenic plants showed that the tryptamine accumulation was consistently associated with adverse effects on feeding potential and physiology of Malacosoma disstria (forest tent caterpillar).@@@Agrobacterium

The initial spacings used in this study were 1.0×1.0 m, 1.5×1.5 m, 2.0×2.0 m, 2.5×2.5 m, 3.0×3.0 m, and 3.5×3.5 m; these are equivalent to 1 m2, 2.25 m2, 4 m2, 6.25 m2, 9 m2 and 12.25 m2 in growing space per tree, respectively. No significant relationship between spacing and tree height was found, but increased spacing increased crown diameter and root-collar-diameter. On the other hand, an increase in spacing reduced wood quality because it increased branch diameter (knot size). Thus, from a wood quality perspective, adopting close spacing in plantations of C. africana could be advantageous.@@@Branching characteristics

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of triclopyr and imazapyr tank mixtures for a variety of rates and species. Imazapyr at the standard rate of 19 g ae/l does not have the broad-spectrum control of triclopyr at the standard rate of 96 g ae/l. Test mixtures adding various rates of imazapyr to the standard rate of triclopyr provided no significant benefit. This study documents effective basal spray treatments for 15 of 16 test species.

Therefore, seeds of slash pine (Pinus elliottii Englm.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were germinated under constant light or constant darkness. A gravitropic set-point angle (GSA) of 90° indicates the radicle is pointed horizontally while a GSA of 0° indicates the radicle is growing toward the center of the earth. After 20 days from sowing, the GSA was less than 10° in both light and darkness. Therefore, gravitropism of both pine species occurred in the dark. The presence of light initially stimulated gravitropism but this effect was ephemeral. After 25 days from sowing, there was no significant difference in radicle growth among light treatments, suggesting that darkness did not affect pine radicle gravitropism. However, light did increase germination of both species. Radicle length was slightly increased when seeds germinated in the dark.@@@Light

Seedlings on a Reforestation Site in Northern Greece@@@@@@Received: 25 November 2002 Accepted: 07 December 2004 Issue Date: March 2006@@@Seedlings of three tree species (Acer pseudoplatanus L., Castanea sativa Miller. and Quercus frainetto Ten.) were planted on a field site in Northern Greece to investigate factors connected to planting failures. On several dates, for the first two growing seasons after planting (1997 and 1998), leaf water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange variables and seedling survival were determined. Q. frainetto seedlings exhibited the lowest values of leaf water potential (Ψ) for most of the season in both studied years. Seedlings of all species showed large reductions in Ψ the mid-summer in both years, with particularly low values in 1998. In both years, a sharp reduction in Ψ was observed at the beginning of July when all three species exhibited their lowest net CO2 assimilation (A) rate by the end of July. In 1997, A recovered after the July depression to values even higher than those recorded in June. However, in 1998, only Q. frainetto and to a lesser degree C. sativa recovered from a similar July depression in physiological values. Species reached their highest A rates by the end of August in 1997 and in June during 1998. In general, stomatal conductance and transpiration rates paralleled the A patterns. In 1997, the seasonal course of effective quantum yield (ΔF/Fm), for all plant species followed a rise-and-fall pattern with a peak at the beginning of July. In 1998, ΔF/Fm values were relatively high in June, showed a deep depression during July and while Q. frainetto and C. sativa recovered afterwards, A. pseudoplatanus continued to exhibit very low values. This study showed that differences in mortality between species were due to differences in tolerance to water stress and the superiority of Q. frainetto was probably related to the fact that it was the only species native and adapted to the planting site@@@Chlorophyll fluorescence

Successful management depends on understanding factors governing tree recruitment during succession. Recruits can be on-site propagules surviving disturbance (e.g. saplings) or seeds arriving after disturbance. Among disturbed sites, the importance of seed arrival from off-site should increase as availability of on-site propagules declines. This study examines how seed arrival from off-site seemed to influence natural forest regrowth on logged plantations in Uganda. Specifically, the effect of seed arrival from mammals (determined directly) and birds (determined inferentially) was estimated in two plantations with high and three plantations with low quantities of saplings surviving logging. In both plantation types, first-year recruitment seemed to originate from on-site (seed bank and sprouts from damaged trees) and off-site sources (seed-dispersing birds). Recruitment declined 2–3 years after logging in all plantations despite high densities of seed-dispersing birds. Recruitment was generally greater in plantations with low initial quantities of on-site propagules, and by 4–6 years forest structure was similar between plantation types. Recruitment was dominated by bird-dispersed species, rather than mammal- or wind-dispersed species. Taken together, these results illustrate that disturbed areas with low initial on-site propagule availability have much potential for forest regrowth.@@@Disturbance

The objective was to compare the effect of three operational harvest methods careful logging around advanced growth (CLAAG), group seed tree (GST), and group seed tree followed by shearblading site preparation (SHE) on natural regeneration in the Clay Belt region of Ontario. A total of 30 stands, 562 cluster sample plots, were surveyed. Total density of black spruce regeneration did not differ, but height structure of black spruce regeneration did among harvest methods. The CLAAG method resulted in highest total regeneration density of other conifers. Decreasing density of other conifers from the CLAAG to GST to SHE sites indicated that the CLAAG method protected advance regeneration as expected and the SHE method removed advance regeneration in the path of the shearing blade. Both black spruce and other conifer regeneration densities increased with increasing time since harvest. Stocking of black spruce, all conifers, or all tree species did not differ significantly among harvest methods, nor did it change with time since harvest. Stocking was nonlinearly related to regeneration density. Models developed in this study predict that full stocking (i.e., 60%) can be reached based on regeneration density of 5000 stems per ha regardless of crop species choice preference. However, the existing stocking criterion for assessing black spruce regeneration may be problematic.@@@Careful logging around advanced growth (CLAAG)

Unger) on intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and their yield were examined over 2 years (1993 and 1994) at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each experiment consisted of three randomized blocks with treatments of three alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8 m) and a treeless control with two intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned subsequently at 2–3 months intervals. No fertilizer was applied but Leucaena loppings were incorporated as green leaf manure. Rust on beans was assessed at three growth stages in each season, using the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) scales. Microclimate was monitored in treatments, in 1994. Bean growth and yield were also measured. Rust increased with increasing alley width and was less severe in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Bean yield was highest in the treeless control plots and declined with decreasing alley width. Beans in 2 m alleys had significantly lower (p < 0.05) yields than 8 m alleys and treeless control plots. Bean growth was greatly modified in 2 m alleys and close to hedgerows. Light availability and diurnal temperature increased with alley width but relative humidity and leaf wetness duration decreased. Proximity to hedgerows also had marked effect on microclimate. The changes in yield, rust incidence and severity were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival and dispersal.@@@Alley farming

MFA was measured for every growth ring at breast height (1.3 m) for all sample trees, and at 0 (butt), 5.6, 9.6, 13.6, 17.6, 19.6 and 21.6 m for clone I-69, Nanlin-95 and Nanlin-895. A total of 900 samples (chips) were assessed. Significant variation was observed among poplar clones and growth rings. Mean clonal MFAs at the breast height ranged from 15.2° to 21.0°. MFA at breast height varied from 7.8° to 28° between growth rings and showed a consistent pith-to-bark trend of declining angles. Disc-average microfibril angle in poplar clones declines rapidly from 0 to 5.6 m height, after which, it is near constant within tree height. Significant variation was also observed in disc-average MFA among tree heights. Correlation analysis showed that the correlation between MFAs from rings 5 to 11 at breast height was significant, while whole-tree values of each growth ring were significantly correlated with the corresponding MFA at breast height. The results of this study provide some basis for genetic selection of poplar trees based on wood-quality criteria and for devising appropriate sampling strategies for MFA measurement.@@@Correlation analysis

A period of 50 days cold stratification and removing seed coat significantly increased germination rate to 55% ± 1.91 (Mean ± SE) and 85% ± 3.00, respectively. None of the seeds with pericarp germinated regardless of treatment they underwent. Results suggested that seed dormancy was mainly due to pericarp and perhaps inhibitors linked to seed coat.@@@GA3

However, when a large number of clones are handled, variations and mixings are commonly confronted which may go undetected in the absence of prominent morphological descriptors. Material from germplasm resources are also used in breeding program. The economic implications of such inadvertent variations could be serious as considerable time and money is spent before the mistakes are detected. This paper reports the identification of mislabeling in Eucalyptus clones maintained through tissue culture, and the reestablishment of the identity of the mislabeled clones using genetic markers viz., RAPDs/AFLPs. The in vitro propagated Eucalyptus plants from two groups, group 1 derived directly from SMD7 (a candidate plus tree), and group 2 derived from coppice shoots of trees of group 1, were assessed for their genetic uniformity using RAPD markers. The small intra-group genetic variations of 0.02 in the second group were attributed to somaclonal variations induced during long culture periods. However, the genetic distances of 0.20 and 0.31 between SMD7 and the two micropropagated groups were too high to be attributed to somaclonal variations as axillary bud culture was used for micropropagation. To test the possibility of inadvertent mixing, RAPD profiles of the micropropagated groups were compared with that of other clones in the tissue-cultured Eucalyptus germplasm. The RAPD profiles of group 2 plantlets matched with that of another unrelated clone in the germplasm. The authenticity of this donor was further re-established using AFLP markers.@@@AFLPs

Our results are based on primary data and information that were sourced from a survey of poplar growers in summer 2000. The results show a growing interest in planting poplars throughout the 1990s. Between 1989 and 1998, poplar plantations were established mainly on land previously used for arable purposes and pastureland, and to a lesser extent, on other lands. Growers perceive that a robust value-added market for poplar products may be developed providing poplar cultivars are properly managed. The most common interamericana clones planted are the varieties Beaupré and Boelare. Specifically, plantation sites are currently using the polyclonal system and are growing on sites that have a diversity (mixture) of other forest species. Loss of resistance to disease organisms (e.g., rust fungi of the genus Melampsora) appears to be one of the main current threats to successful poplar exploitation.@@@Multiple use crop

Open Pollinated Families at an Early Age: Growth, Gas Exchange and Water Relations@@@@@@Received: 14 March 2003 Accepted: 24 May 2005 Issue Date: May 2006@@@Growth and physiological responses of Pinus pinaster Ait. to water and nutrient availability were compared in four open pollinated families of Arenas de San Pedro provenance (Central Iberian Peninsula), looking for more useful parameters and growing conditions to be included in early selection programmes of forest trees. Young seedlings were grown in a greenhouse, subjected to high and low water and nutrient regimes, during 14 weeks. Interfamily differences were significant with regard to growth, nutrient content and water-use efficiency (WUE): differences in growth were higher under more favourable growing conditions; gas exchange differences were higher in the short term (9 weeks), indicating a faster reaction to water stress of the better adapted families to these conditions; the highest growth rates were found in the families with the largest plasticity, highest WUE and highest nutrient content. Water regime and nutrients had significant effects on growth, δ13C, gas exchange and water relation parameters. For these parameters the ranking of the families was kept regardless the water × nutrient supply combination and there was not a significant family × treatment interaction. In the long term (14 weeks) higher water supply and nutrient content significantly increased instantaneous WUE. The positive relationships between growth, intrinsic WUE (A/g wv) and δ13C demonstrate that it should be possible to use physiological parameters (e.g. g wv, δ13C) as a surrogate for the efficiency in the use of water, at least if short periods of water stress (up to 2 months long) were frequent, as it occurs in the Mediterranean basin. There was also some indication that the decrease in nitrogen or potassium supply led to increasing stomatal conductance and hence lower WUE.@@@Carbon isotopic composition

Seedlings are rare even though potential seed production is enormous. The aim of this study was to find out how different moisture conditions affect emergence and survival of aspen seedlings on burned soil. We set up a sowing experiment on mineral soil and on humus. The sowing was done at 240 microsites (θ7 cm) in 15 blocks (1×1 m). Treatments were sowing time, watering and sowing shelter. A total of 1463 seedlings emerged on mineral soil and 26 on humus. Watering, covering, their interaction, block and sowing time had significant effects on the number of seedlings. The largest numbers of seedlings were recorded at microsites that were watered and covered. The survival of seedlings was 20% during the growing season and 45% over winter. We conclude that seedbed conditions and moisture are the most essential factors for sexual reproduction of aspen. Short-term weather conditions have an important effect on seedling emergence and are likely to greatly affect field studies.@@@Boreal forest

One such model, Full Carbon Accounting Model (FullCAM), calculates stem mass by taking annual inputs of tree growth in stem volume and multiplying these by basic stem wood density. Stem mass is then multiplied by user-entered coefficients to determine the mass of other tree components. Using datasets of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus that comprised of between 73 and 187 observations, we determined empirical relationships that can be used in FullCAM to relate basic stem wood density to stand age, and masses of bark, foliage or branches to mass of stem wood for these two species. All fitted relationships were highly significant (p < 0.001), explaining between 35 and 89% of the variance. These calibrations were then tested using three case studies where data on volume yield curves and repeated measures of biomass of stand components were available: one of P. radiata and two of E. globulus. Although accumulation of biomass in foliage and branches were not well predicted by the model, sensitivity analysis showed that this was relatively unimportant to total carbon storage because of the dominance of the stem, particularly once the stand is older than 5 years. Indeed, FullCAM accounted for 99% of the variance in measured above-ground biomass at all three sites because calibrations for the mass of stem was reasonably well constrained. Uncertainty analysis showed that despite the standard errors of parameters used in relationships for basic density and biomass partitioning, and for estimates of carbon contents of tree components, we can be 95% confident that sequestration of carbon in trees and debris of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus plantations are, on average, within 13% of that predicted by FullCAM.@@@CAMFor

The orchards differed in fertility of clones as well as flower and fruit production per ramet. Fertility was highly skewed in CSO-II, where one clone (originating from higher latitude −17° N, in Eastern Ghats of peninsular India) produced 55% of the fruits and 68% of the flowers in the orchard, in contrast to a similar contribution from four most fertile clones in CSO-I. Fertility variation, measured as `sibling coefficient' (1.7 in CSO-I and 8.3 in CSO-II), was high in CSO-II resulting in high coancestry and low effective population size (3 times lower than CSO-I) in the seed crop. In CSO-I, 58% of the clones contributed effectively to seed production compared to only 12% effective contribution resulting in eight times higher genetic drift in CSO-II. Placing limits on how much seed can be collected per clone might be useful in restricting over representation of highly reproductive clones thereby increasing genetic diversity in the seed crop.@@@Clone

We investigated acorn removal and seedling survival of Quercus germana and Q. xalapensis in relation to woody plant density across old field-forest gradients with soft and abrupt edges. Experiments were established along four parallel bands located at 40–50 m in the forest, forest and field edges (0–10 m to each side of the border), and 20–30 m in the old field. Within each band, woody plant and acorn density was measured, and four points for acorn and seedling removal experiments were randomly positioned. In each position, 20 acorns or four seedlings were placed. Survival was monitored during one month. In abrupt edges, acorn density was higher along edges than in forest interior. Also, higher acorn removal and seedling mortality were observed in the adjacent old-field whereas acorn and seedling survival was the highest at the edges. Acorn and seedling survival was positively correlated to woody vegetation density. As the vegetation density of field and forest edges grows, abrupt edges develop into soft edges, and they become more hospitable to oak recruitment and then to forest cover expansion.@@@Cloud forest

Measurements were made during the second year after establishment in the field under two watering regimes, which were defined by the time-span between flood irrigations, hence resulting in different dry-down cycles: high irrigation (conservative schedule currently applied in the Ebro Valley, Spain) and low irrigation (equivalent to about a one-fourth reduction in water inputs). Net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g s), intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g s) and other related photosynthetic traits (leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf greenness and leaf mass per area) were measured prior to watering, and Δ was analysed in water-soluble leaf extracts (Δs) and bulk leaves (Δl). Stem growth was monitored over 3 years starting at the year of establishment (1998). Data were subjected to a repeated measures ANOVA over time for a randomised block split-plot design across watering regimes. Significant differences between watering regimes were detected using a long-term estimate of photosynthetic performance such as Δl, in agreement with changes in soil water status and evapotranspirative demand. However, the lack of significant genotype×watering regime interactions for gas exchange traits and Δs suggested that water shortage imposed by low irrigation was not sufficient to reveal physiological adaptations to drought. In this regard, the reduction in water inputs brought about by low irrigation did not reduce tree growth for any of the clones, suggesting that the current irrigation scheme employed in the region is superfluous to the water consumption needs of poplars. Genotypic variation was detected in gas exchange traits, Δs, Δl and stem growth under both watering treatments. Significant correlations with stem volume for Δs (r = −0.60, p<0.05) and A (r = + 0.61, p<0.05) suggested that growth was improved by higher water-use efficiency (the ratio of carbon fixed to water lost, as inferred by Δs) due to variation in A rather than in g s. This observation corroborated the expectation derived from current theories that a lower Δ is related to higher stem volume, as a result of changes in net CO2 assimilation rates.@@@Clone

"267","Quality Assessment of Temperate Zone Deciduous Hardwood Seedlings@@@@@@Received: 18 May 2004 Accepted: 11 July 2005 Issue Date: May 2006@@@Research regarding seedling quality issues has been performed for decades and focused primarily on conifer species, which comprise the greatest proportion of nursery production worldwide. Demand for hardwood seedlings, particularly for conservation purposes, has increased steadily in recent years, emphasizing the need for seedling quality assessment protocols specific to these species. Important differences between conifer (gymnosperm) and hardwood (angiosperm) species require the creation of seedling evaluative programs specific to each group. Variation in phenology and ecological adaptability of hardwood species limits the validity of inferences made between and within genera. Annual cycles of leaf emergence followed by abscission in temperate hardwoods necessitate examination of seasonal variation in indicators of physiological condition that do not require leaf tissue (e.g., mineral nutrition, electrolyte leakage). Also, it is crucial to identify appropriate sampling periods and plant tissues for testing such that test results may be accurately compared. Though certain parameters (e.g., morphological) may be readily used in both conifer and hardwood seedling quality testing programs with little modification, additional refinement is needed to improve predictive capacity for hardwoods across a variety of environments. We review the current state of knowledge regarding seedling quality testing of temperate deciduous hardwood species, discuss limitations in incorporating traditional components of quality testing programs, and set priorities for future study.@@@Chlorophyll fluorescence

"268","Mating System and Pollen Contamination in a Pinus brutia Seed Orchard@@@@@@Received: 10 October 2003 Accepted: 05 July 2005 Issue Date: May 2006@@@Mating system parameters and pollen contamination were estimated in an 11-year-old Pinus brutia Ten. clonal seed orchard, located in Antalya, Turkey, with the aid of isozymes. Isozyme analysis was performed on both maternal (megagametophyte) and embryo tissues of seeds collected from the seed orchard and the surrounding natural stand. Fourteen loci encoding nine enzyme systems were assayed. Based on a multilocus estimator, the proportion of viable seeds originating from outcrossing (tˆm ) in the seed orchard was found to be 0.947; the remainder (0.053) was due to selfing. We estimated that 85.7% of the orchard seed resulted from pollen contamination by trees in surrounding stands. This may be related to the young age and subsequent low pollen production of the orchard. Only 9% [i.e., 1.0−0.857 (contamination)−0.053 (selfing) = 0.090] of the orchard offspring was due to cross-pollination among clones within the orchard. Due to the high level of pollen contamination, it is estimated that genetic gain in this seed crop is less than 57% of that expected if all offspring resulted from random mating among orchard clones (i.e., no contamination).@@@Gene flow

"269","Natural Variation in Seed Characteristics of Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus L.)@@@@@@Received: 04 May 2004 Accepted: 06 October 2005 Issue Date: July 2006@@@Natural variation in seed characteristics of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) trees and its relationship with the size, form, and crown class of parent trees was examined in second-growth, white pine mixedwood stands in Ontario. Cones were collected prior to and following partial harvesting of two stands during 2 years of above-average seed production. Fully enlarged seed extracted from mature cones was X-rayed to determine seed yield per cone, the percentage of sound, partially filled, and empty seed, and the sound seed mass for each tree. Variation in seed yield per cone, the proportion of sound, partially filled, and empty seed, and seed mass was much greater among individuals than between stands or seed years. The strength and significance of the relationship of seed mass with sound seed yield differed with stand and seed year. In uncut stands, seed mass was higher for trees with dominant crown class, larger live crown ratios, and smaller height to diameter ratios, suggesting tree vigour and microsite quality influence seed mass. Proportion of partially filled seeds was significantly reduced in both stands in the second year likely due to increased growing degree days during female gametophyte development. The implications of these results to natural and artificial regeneration of white pine are discussed.@@@Inbreeding

Seedlings on a Bottomland Site in the Southern United States@@@@@@Received: 28 June 2004 Accepted: 07 October 2005 Issue Date: July 2006@@@We initiated a study on a bottomland site in the southern United States to examine the effects of Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunberg) control and seedlings of two root classes on survival and growth of underplanted cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) seedlings. Three honeysuckle control treatments were assigned to nine 0.5-ha plots in a stand harvested to 30% residual stocking. Treatments included a spring 1997 herbicide application (Escort®, metsulfuron-methyl), a similar application in the late summer of 1997, and a control (no herbicide application). In 1998, half of each treatment plot was planted with seedlings having four or more first-order lateral roots > 1 mm in diameter, while the other half of each plot received seedlings with fewer than four lateral roots. Four years after treatment, the early season application reduced honeysuckle biomass 60% relative to the other treatments, but we did not observe a survival or growth response by underplanted seedlings. Three years after establishment, seedlings that initially had four or more lateral roots were 16% taller and 18% larger in root-collar diameter than seedlings in the other class, but these differences were primarily due to initial size differences maintained through the study period. Over all treatments, oak seedlings averaged 87% survival while showing a 300% increase in height and a 170% increase in root-collar diameter 3 years after planting. Our results suggest that partial stand harvesting followed by underplanting may be a viable approach for establishing cherrybark oak reproduction on bottomland sites of the southern United States.@@@Competition

Bulk seed samples were collected from six natural populations in Ethiopia and examined for variations in seed morphometric traits, seed germination, and seedling growth at nursery stage. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among provenances in all studied attributes except root collar diameter after 4 months of growth. The provenance effect, as determined by broad sense heritability, was 71–98% for seed morphometric traits, 80% for germination capacity, 42% for germination energy, 57–58% for seedling height and 3–13% for root collar diameter. Seed weight showed a significant positive correlation with altitude and negative correlation with mean annual temperature of seed origin. Germination energy was significantly correlated with longitude and mean annual rainfall. Seedling parameters and geo-climatic variables of seed origin were fairly correlated. A significant intercharacter correlation was found between seed length and seed weight, between root collar diameter at the age of 4 months and seed length and weight, as well as between seedling height after 4 and 8 months of growth. It can be concluded that the observed patterns of variation will have implications for genetic resources conservation and tree improvement.@@@Ethiopia

In this paper, the impacts of the protection on the forest growth were assessed using geographic information system (GIS) technologies. The major requirement for almost all research needed for sustainable forest management is extensive and intensive monitoring. GIS is a convenient tool for integrating remotely sensed data and various other kinds geo-referenced data. Detailed spatial and temporal change patterns of the land uses in the area were quantified by interpreting aerial photographs of the years 1945 and 1973 and a satellite image of 2001. The results showed that the rate of forest growth is significantly larger during the second period (1973–2001) than during the earlier one (1945–1973). This is mostly due to the introduction, in 1980, of a protection regime, including two high-protection core areas, and a buffer zone. From 1945 to 2001 the openings which are important as hunting biotopes for raptors were significantly decreased. Apart from the protection of the area that was played an important role in the forest changes the effects of various landscape parameters (elevation, slope, distance from the roads and urban areas, aspect, soil depth, geology, erosion and forest density) on these changes were examined.@@@Deforestation

Percent germination and speed of germination under laboratory conditions were not related to seed mass among half-sib families or multi-family seedlots bulked by seed mass. Percent seedling emergence in the greenhouse was not related to seed mass, but families with heavier seeds exhibited faster emergence. Both rate and percent emergence were significantly increased under low light. Family differences in leaf, stem, root, and total seedling dry mass, primary root length, and the number of first-order-lateral-roots were positively related to seed mass in both light environments. Low light diminished the absolute biomass increment per unit seed mass, but the proportional change in biomass with seed mass was similar between light environments. Rate of emergence also influenced seedling size within families, with earlier emergence increasing seedling dry mass from 7 to 58%, dependent on light environment. Biomass partitioning coefficients were influenced by light environment but largely independent of seed mass.@@@Natural regeneration

Karst.) seed stands from the Istebna region in the Beskidy Mountains of Poland. Significant differences were found among population in growth initiation, growth termination and the length of shoot elongation period. The two latter traits were highly correlated and were attributed to the altitude of the maternal stand. The tested populations were grouped based on phenology. Progeny of lower-alttitude stands ceased growth later, had a longer duration of shoot growth and greater current leader length compared to progeny of higher-altitude stands. Individual populations, however, did not differ in current-year growth and total tree height, implying higher within-population variation in growth traits than in phenology. The similar growth capacity of all tested populations suggests considerable gene flow between maternal stands, although differences in phenology imply the adaptation of progenies to the altitudinal environment of seed origin. These results suggest that within tested populations, selection is possible based on phenology alone, without considerable reduction of early height growth; final decisions, however, should be based on the environmental conditions of the planting site.@@@Elevation

"275","Seed Development, Maturation and Storage Behaviour of Mimusops elengi L.@@@@@@Received: 03 February 2004 Accepted: 08 September 2005 Issue Date: July 2006@@@Mass maturity (end of the seed-filling phase) occurred at about 72 days after flowering (DAF) in developing seeds of Mimusops elengi, at which time seed moisture content had declined to about 55%. The onset of ability to germinate was detected at 56 DAF and seeds showed 98% germination by 84 DAF. Tolerance of desiccation to 10% moisture content was first detected at 70 DAF and was maximal by 84 DAF. Delaying collection by a further 14 days to 98 DAF, when fruits began to be shed, reduced seed viability, particularly for seeds first dried to 10% moisture content. Hence the best time for seed collection appears to be about 14 days before fruits shed. In a separate investigation with six different seed lots, desiccation below about 8–12% moisture content reduced viability (considerably in some lots). The viability of dry seeds (below about 10% moisture content) stored hermetically was reduced at cool temperatures (5 °C and below), and none survived storage at sub-zero temperatures. The results suggest that Mimusops elengi shows intermediate seed storage behaviour and that the optimal hermetic seed storage environment is about 10% moisture content at 10 °C, while short-term, moist, aerated storage at high (40%) moisture content is also feasible.@@@Desiccation

Survival, growth and damage were studied in eight clear felled stands regenerated in 1972. Five of the areas were planted with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and three with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The plantings were examined in 1972 and 1974. In 1974, the number of living undamaged planted seedlings was low (10–15%). However, the number of undamaged seedlings was supplemented by naturally regenerated conifer and birch seedlings. The total number of undamaged seedling in 1974 was equivalent to 20–30% of the number of seedlings planted. In 1998, the main species in three stands had changed from Norway spruce to Scots pine, and in one stand from Norway spruce to birches. Actual volume in 1998 for the stands was compared to stand volume generate according to five scenarios based on recommended and actual seedling number in 1972 and 1974. The actual volume was 64% of that expected if the recommended number of trees had been planted. Naturally regenerated Scots pine and Norway spruce increased stand density in 1998. The actual volume was 37% higher than the average volume in the surrounding county. On average, 36% of the trees were damaged. More than 50% of the total damage was caused by moose (Alces alces L.). For Scots pine, moose or other browsing animals damaged 30% of the trees. The results of this study indicate that the 1998 volume was higher than expected, considering the low number of undamaged seedlings in 1974. This was mainly due to the large amount of naturally regenerated plants. In addition, the results indicate that the volume could have been higher if the initial conditions had been better. Despite the low number of undamaged seedlings in 1974, seven of the eight studied stands produced a higher volume than the average stand for the region. In practise, high numbers of seedlings should be planted on scarified areas. In most cases there will be a supply of naturally regenerated seedlings.@@@Bare-root seedling

We also evaluated whether populations of S. argenteus in pine–oak vegetation and in C. lindleyi plantations had a clumped distribution. Finally, we evaluated whether advanced regeneration of different species was higher under the crown of S. argenteus than around it. Density of S. argenteus was higher in pine–oak forest than under plantations, but density in plantations was high. The structure of populations of S. argenteus in pine–oak vegetation had more individuals with ≤ 0.5 and >2 m, while populations in plantations had more individuals in intermediate height categories. Both populations were clumped. Only one species, Rubus liebmannii had higher densities under S. argenteus, so that other species might also colonize C. lindleyi plantations as a consequence to their affinity to S. argenteus. Although S. argenteus and other native species were apparently establishing under C. lindleyi plantations, Pinus and Quercus, the dominant genera of this forest type, were not. Consequently other activities, like liberation thinning, might be required to re-establish natural vegetation under C. lindleyi plantations.@@@Advanced regeneration

Freshly harvested seeds of local poplar were placed on MS agar medium and plantlets were obtained. After 1 year of subcultivation, plantlets were infected with a transconjugant of triparental mating with target ugt and acb genes into axillary buds. The transformed sprouts so obtained were cut and subcultivated on agar medium with an addition of 0.6 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid as an auxin source. The transformed sprouts showed GUS activity and resistance to gentamycin and kanamycin. The integrity of the target ugt and acb genes into poplar genome was demonstrated via PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. The transgenic poplar plants revealed a higher growth energy, corresponding to a higher content of IAA as opposed to control plants. Both transgenic and non-transformed plants were potted into soil for outdoor acclimatisation and subsequently transferred to earth in beds. Growing outside during 3 years, the transgenic poplar demonstrated a higher growth rate with fast bud and branch development.@@@acb

These 12 loci were chosen from a set of 17 candidate loci used to genotype 222 trees sampled from a 38-year-old black walnut progeny test. The 222 genotypes represent a sampling from the broad geographic distribution of the species. Analysis of the samples using the 12 loci revealed an average expected heterozygosity of 0.83, a combined probability of identity of 3×10−19, and a combined probability of exclusion for paternity analysis of >0.999. The 222 genotyped trees from the progeny test comprised 39 open-pollinated families, 29 of which (having at least five sampled progeny) were used to estimate the outcrossing rate for the progeny trial. The same 29 families were used to construct a Neighbor-Joining dendrogram based upon allele sharing between individuals. The multilocus estimate of the outcrossing rate was 100% (standard error of zero), higher than the 90% level found in previous studies at the embryo stage, suggesting that both artificial and natural selection against selfs may have occurred over the 38-year lifespan of the progeny trial. In the Neighbor-Joining dendrogram, the majority of the putative siblings grouped together in 21 out of the 29 families, showing that the microsatellites were able to discern most of the family structure in the dataset. Our results indicate that errors were sometimes committed during the establishment of the progeny test. This set of microsatellite loci clearly provides a powerful tool for future applications in black walnut.@@@Allele sharing

The comparative effects of strip clearing and total clearing, both treatments applied with or without herbicide, on competing vegetation cover, light availability, and survival and growth of planted white ash (Fraxinus americana L.) were examined in two different shrub dominated sites for 3 years in southwestern Québec, Canada. Survival was high in all treatments. At the site with the richest soil and in comparison to total clearing, strip clearing produced the lowest light level in the third year, which induced lower total herbaceous weed cover. These combined effects produced the same growth results for white ash seedlings in all treatments. At the second site, with the highest woody vegetation regrowth, strip clearing has promoted seedling height growth and produced the highest height: diameter ratio for white ash. This ratio was also superior at this site in the absence of herbicide. Treatment effects were soil/site dependant. Because partial clearing in strips has never reduced tree growth in comparison to total clearing, it represents a promising method for the establishment of valuable hardwoods in shrubby vegetation, with lower management intensity and lower landscape impact than total clearing.@@@Hardwood plantation

In addition, the effects of desiccation and different storage conditions on the germination of S. nux-vomica seeds were investigated. The results show that soaking in 500 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) for 24 h, incubation of seeds at 40 °C for 3 days and alternate water soaking (16 h) and drying (8 h) for 14 days significantly increased the percentage germination compared to the control. Desiccation of seeds down to 10% moisture content resulted in better germination. Germination of S. nux-vomica seeds differed significantly between different storage periods, moisture contents of the seed and for first and second order interactions (p<0.001). The highest germination (92%) was achieved when seeds with 10% moisture content were stored at ambient temperature for 30 weeks. Evidence from the present study indicates that S. nux-vomica seeds possess physiological dormancy that can be broken effectively by after-ripening. As seeds of S. nux-vomica are found to be desiccation tolerant, dry seed (10% moisture content) can be hermitically stored at ambient temperature for 30 weeks without losing their viability.@@@After-ripening

Seedlings were grown in StyroblocksTM, CopperblocksTM, or AirBlocksTM, and were planted directly into the undisturbed forest floor or into manually prepared planting spots where the forest floor had been scraped away to expose the mineral soil. Seedlings planted into scalped planting spots exhibited marginally but significantly (7%) greater above-ground growth rates (seedling stem volume); whereas seedlings planted into the forest floor produced significantly more (11%) new roots. There were no differences in above- or below-ground biomass. Seedlings grown in CopperblockTM containers produced a higher proportion of roots near the top of the plug when tested at lifting, however this pattern was not observed in the field. Given that scalping is more costly than forest floor planting, and that the increased shoot growth was relatively small, we recommend that forest floor planting be considered as an alternative to manual spot scalping for sites, such as the site tested here: those with cold, but well-drained soils and where competition from other plants is not a serious problem.@@@Container type

A 3 year study was established in 2000 in a cutover bottomland hardwood forest in west Alabama to examine the influences of seedling browse protection and fertilizer use on growth of Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii Palm.) seedlings. The treatments included: control, 1.2 m tall wire tree shelter, and 1.2 m tall plastic tree shelter. Fertilizer (20–10–5) was applied to one-half of all seedlings at planting. Competing vegetation was controlled around all seedlings with mulch mats and herbicide. Fertilization did not affect height growth or successful establishment after 3 years. Four percent of protected seedlings (plastic and wire tree shelters combined) were browsed compared to 95% of control seedlings. After 3 years, plastic tree shelters were the most effective treatment for promoting height growth and successful seedling establishment of Nuttal oak seedlings (193 cm, 92.71% compared to 120 cm, 68.75% and 52 cm, 8.33% for wire tree shelter, and control seedlings, respectively).

This study compares the genetic variation of an artificially regenerated population with its donor population and two other wild populations, by using RAPD markers. A total of 74 clear, reproducible bands were scored for 12 RAPD primers; 72 were polymorphic (P = 97.3%). AMOVA revealed that most genetic variation was within populations and only 10.35% was among populations. Various measures indicated that there is no difference in genetic diversity between the planted and the original populations. ΦST between the planted offspring population and the donor population was larger than those between the planted and other two natural populations, indicating that artificial regeneration might lead to biased genetic composition, given that temporal differentiation is usually lower than spatial differentiation. This divergence may be due to unequal seed production among the maternal individuals and viability differences among seeds.@@@Regeneration

In this study, the interactions between the mycorrhizal fungi Boletus edulis, Rhizopogon roseolus, Laccaria laccata and Lactarius deliciosus and damping off pathogens (Fusarium oxysporum and F. moniliforme) were investigated in vitro and mechanisms involved in the protection of damping off in P. nigra seedlings are also discussed. The effect of filtrates from mycorrhizal species on spore germination of F. oxysporum varied throughout the tests. At the end of the assay, the inhibitory effect only could be observed in the L.␣deliciosus treatment. None of the filtrates reduced spore germination in F. moniliforme. Finally, three of the four mycorrhizal species grown for 2 months in the substrate, L. laccata, L.␣deliciosus and B. edulis, increased the survival of Fusarium inoculated P.␣nigra seedlings.@@@Damping off

We compared three methods using container-grown seedlings of Douglas-fir, interior spruce, lodgepole pine, and western larch from forest nurseries in British Columbia. On three to nine dates in autumn, frost hardiness at −18°C was estimated using visible injury of foliage or stems (VI), electrolyte leakage from needles or stems (EL), and chlorophyll fluorescence of shoots (CF). Seedlings were placed into overwinter cold storage (−2°C). In the spring, stored seedlings were planted in nursery beds; survival and growth were assessed after one growing season. There were close correlations (r ≥ 0.93) between the assessment methods. Seedlings lifted after they reached thresholds of 69% or higher for CF and 25% or lower for EL and VI had over 90% survival at harvest and doubled shoot dry weight compared with seedlings lifted earlier. Measuring CF was the fastest and most easily replicated method to estimate successful storability, and reduced testing time by 6 days relative to VI tests.@@@Chlorophyll fluorescence

"289","Does mechanical site preparation affect trembling aspen density and growth 9–12 years after treatment?@@@@@@Received: 22 September 2004 Accepted: 07 February 2006 Published: 20 October 2006 Issue Date: November 2006@@@Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) density and growth were assessed 9–12 years after stand establishment to determine whether mechanical site preparation (MSP) affects crop tree quality. Study sites were either treated with disc trenching or ripper ploughing and planted with white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) seedlings immediately after harvest (treated) or were undisturbed since harvest (control). Stands were surveyed during the summer of 2002 with standard regeneration survey plots. Results show that aspen stem density and height were lower in MSP-treated areas relative to untreated areas. Diameter growth rates were unaffected by treatment, however the percentage of stem discolouration was higher in untreated control stands compared to site prepared areas. The results of this study indicate that there are no long-term benefits to carry out MSP for aspen promotion. However, as MSP does not appear to seriously harm the aspen crop, we suggest that this treatment can still be used on sites where aspen densities may be low without treatment (e.g., sites with extremely low soil temperatures, poor soil aeration, or vigorous competitive vegetation) or where a mixture of aspen and planted spruce are desired.@@@Boreal

A tree screening trial was conducted from 1997 to 2002 in Ginchi (central Ethiopia) to select fast growing and high biomass producing tree species; evaluate foliage macronutrient concentration of different tree species; and assess effects of trees on soil chemical properties beneath their canopies. Acacia decurrens Willd, A. mearnsii De Wild and Eucalyptus globulus Labill attained the highest height growth at 64 months as compared to other indigenous and exotic species. E. globulus provided better height increment from 24 to 36 and 36 to 64 months than other tree and shrub species. Acacia mearnssi and A. saligna Labill Wendl produced high biomass at 40 and 64 months. Differences between the highest and lowest dry biomass at 12, 40 and 64 months were 1.13, 29.19 and 38.89 kg tree−1, respectively. None of the tree species resulted in a foliage to stem biomass ratio of >0.98 at 40 and 64 months. Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr had high N and P concentrations in its foliages and stems at 12 and 40 months. Total N under Acacia abyssinica Hochst.

Karst.) plantations in southern Finland using regeneration survey data. Regeneration establishment was described by seven response variables: number of planted spruces, natural Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.), natural spruces, natural seed-origin birches (Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. pendula Roth.) and other broadleaves (i.e. sprout-origin birches and other broadleaves than birch), as well as height of crop-tree spruce and dominant height of broadleaves. Due to the multivariate (several responses for each plot) and multilevel (plot, stand, municipality, forest centre) structure, regeneration establishment was modelled by fitting a multivariate multilevel model with explanatory variables such as temperature sum, site fertility, soil quality and method of site preparation. In the model, the numbers of tree seedlings were modelled using over-dispersed Poisson distributed equations, and the tree heights were modelled using normally distributed linear equations. The estimated fixed and random parameters of the equations were logical, and there was no serious bias in predicting the regeneration establishment in the independent test data set. This modelling approach can be used to predict the regeneration establishment stochastically by taking into account the large unexplained variation in regeneration models.@@@Generalized linear mixed models

Following stratification (0, 2, 4 and 8 weeks), acorns were germinated, and acorn moisture content and germination performance were also determined at various times during desiccation. In early December unsprouted acorns were planted in containers, and in early April sprouted acorns, which had been stored in polyethylene bags at 4 °C, with radicles left intact or with radicles pruned back to 1.0 cm were planted in containers.

Stratification for 2 and 4 weeks did not increase germination percentage but significantly increased germination rate. Germination percentage of the seeds dropped when the moisture content of the seeds was reduced by desiccation, and the critical minimum moisture content of the recalcitrant Q. vulcanica acorns was found to be 11–16%. Spring sowing of sprouted acorns altered the morphology the containerized seedlings and caused the formation of significantly more main roots, but resulted in significantly less shoot height and shoot dry weight. Spring-sown sprouted acorns had also a significant advantage over the fall-sown unsprouted acorns in seedling survival, and thus nursery personnel should not be concerned if acorns sprout before sowing.@@@Drying

At each site, twenty seven open pollinated families derived from plus trees selected in mature plantations in Galicia (NW Spain) were planted under 9 fertilization treatments following a split-plot design. One year after planting, P and Mg fertilization significantly increased height growth whereas N did not affect or even significantly reduced height growth. Fertilization×site interaction was not significant indicating parallel responses to fertilization in the three sites. Fertilization × genotype interaction was significant in only one site, suggesting some genetic variation in the nutrient use efficiency among the studied genotypes. However, the lack of a significant interaction in the other two sites, and the lack of consistence among the genotypic stability in relation to fertilization across sites, hinder the possibility of breeding in relation to the nutrient efficiency of the genotypes. Indications for further research are given.@@@Genetic variation

The corporation has significant interests in a range of products including gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, base and ferrous metals, industrial minerals and forest products. The corporation was founded in 1917 by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer in order to exploit South Africa’s gold reserves (Anglo American, 2005f). Business interests within the Southern African region grew in subsequent years: Anglo became the largest shareholder in De Beers; the company instigated development of the Zambian copperbelt and became involved in the exploitation of platinum group ores in South Africa. Further business and geographical diversification followed in subsequent decades as the company built businesses or made acquisitions within the coal, steel and paper industries. The company also developed interests in chemicals, construction, newspapers and financial services. From the mid-late 1990s, accelerating after 1999, considerable corporate restructuring was undertaken including the sale of non resource-based businesses and the ‘unravelling many of the cross holdings which had previously characterised many leading South African corporations’. Thus, various subsidiaries were bought out and operational functions within De Beers were streamlined.

A major advantage of the social capital literature is that it facilitates measurement of the inputs and outputs of corporate citizenship programmes in a way that allows comparisons of levels and distribution of corporate community engagement activities to be made. The measures of community engagement are reported for each firm in two samples of multinationals and subjected to some statistical analysis. A major benefit of our analysis in contrast to previous studies of corporate giving is that we can focus on community engagement in individual countries (for which corporate giving data is not usually available).

Naomi Klein’s (2000) No Logo and Noreena Hertz’s (2001) The Silent Takeover have raised the spectre of global corporations who show little concern for their effect on vulnerable host communities and who are more powerful than many of the governments that welcome them across their borders. As such multinationals are often perceived to be in the process of destroying local cultures and replacing them with homogenised western values. Multinational production methods are accused of exploiting desperate workers and having low labour and environmental standards. The process of globalisation which multinationals represent is credited with undermining the power of national governments to control their economic destiny, leaving them vulnerable to the subsequent exit of footloose capital and undermining their tax base, by promoting tax competition among governments to attract them in the first place. Even more moderate writers such as Stopford, Strange and Henley (1991) recognise that a world with increasingly significant large global firms poses a fundamental challenge for developing country governments: change national economic policies (good or bad) or lose multinational investments.

The reality that such initiatives are being supported at a multilateral level is suggestive of the extent to which notions of corporate citizenship are entering mainstream thinking concerning the role of multinational corporations (MNCs) in the present phase of globalisation. The chapter continues by examining one aspect of corporate citizenship, philanthropy (or giving), which has a long-standing tradition in the USA and we continue our comparative analysis through an examination of current trends in philanthropic activity in the UK and the USA.

Seedlings were subjected to 12-h short-day treatments of 0 (T0), 3 (T3), 7 (T7), 10 (T10), or 15 (T15) days, followed by 0, 7, 17, 40, or 46 days of reduced N supply, respectively. Relevant physiological and morphological factors were examined concurrently. Foliar N concentrations exceeded optimal levels and differed little among treatments, suggesting a minor confounding role for N reduction. Both frost and drought tolerance increased incrementally from T0 through T15. Electrolyte leakage index decreased steadily from T0 (25% for roots, 17% for needles) to T15 (1% for roots, 2% for needles) after 2-h exposure of fine roots to − 2°C and of needles to − 8°C. Withholding soil watering for 19 days caused 80% mortality among seedlings in T0, 50% in T3, and < 10% in T7–T15. The transpiration decline curve suggested that enhanced drought tolerance was largely attributable to quicker stomatal closure during water stress and lower cuticular transpiration rate. The treatments increased root growth capacity on a per-seedling, but not per-root-mass, basis. Needle primordia were developed in all T7-T15 seedlings but not in T0 and T3 treatments, suggesting that nurseries may need no more than 7 days of blackout application for conditioning spruce seedlings for summer planting. Shoot dry weight fraction increased gradually from T0 through T15 and was linearly correlated with needle specific weight and frost tolerance, and may thus be useful in monitoring progress of conditioning treatments.@@@Short-day

Within row spacings were: 4.3, 5.0, 6.3, 8.3, and 12.5 cm, and there were five rows at 20 cm apart, or three rows at 33 cm apart across the 1.2 m wide seedbeds. Both spacings within and between rows significantly affected shoot height, root collar diameter, root dry weight and shoot dry weight, but not root/shoot ratio. Wider spacings produced larger seedlings, but only the wider spacing within rows significantly increased fine and coarse root mass. Provenances showed significant differences in diameter, root/shoot ratio, and fine and coarse roots, and they also showed interactions with row spacings in height and diameter measurements. One year after outplanting, diameter growth was significantly related to provenance, and diameter growth was 88% greater for trees from 33 cm nursery row spacing than those from 20 cm nursery row spacing.@@@Nursery

In summer 2002 and 2003, water relations and gas exchange parameters were measured to address the impact of drought on the seedlings. Chlorophyll a fluorescence was also measured to explore leaf photochemistry and a possible non-stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (A). Reduction in stomatal conductance (g) in response to the decrease of predawn water potential (Ψpd) resulted the main cause affecting net carbon uptake. Water potential at midday (Ψmd) was similar in both species but Quercus petraea was more sensitive to soil water deployment occurred along summer, showing slightly lower Ψpd because worse recover of water potential during night. Rate of photosynthesis was higher in Q.␣pyrenaica probably in relation to its greater leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content per leaf area (Na). Mortality was highest in the clearing and lowest in the thinned pinewood. Throughout the summer, soil moisture was higher in the thinned area, possibly because of the reduction in tree transpiring surface and interception of rainfall. Accordingly, Ψpd of both species was higher in the thinned site.@@@Gas exchange

"312","Naturally revegetated forest governed by mudflow induced sediment heterogeneity@@@@@@Received: 30 May 2005 Accepted: 26 April 2006 Published: 16 June 2006 Issue Date: January 2007@@@We investigated an upstream area of the 1926 Taisho Mudflow that occurred at Mount Tokachi, a volcano in central Hokkaido, Japan, to clarify the relationship between natural forest succession and mudflow-induced sediment characteristics. The study area was divided into three parts, i.e., undisturbed, deposition, and scoured areas, based on disturbance regimes. The deposition area was further divided into three different forest stands for a final total of five forest stand types. We assumed that the mudflow regimes created sediment edaphic heterogeneity and undisturbed and island forests supplied seeds for natural revegetation. The undisturbed forest stand comprised pioneer species, whereas a mosaic forest consisting of almost pure stands characterized by Betula ermanii and Picea glehnii developed in the mudflow. This indicates that each plant species has a characteristic ability to establish and adapt initially and later develop into a mosaic forest according to sediment edaphic conditions, particularly depth, grain size distribution, and water and nutrient gradients. The differences in forest species composition and a 30-year time lag between the development of forest stands at the distal edges and the center explain how the cross-sectional sediment edaphic heterogeneity created by the mudflow regimes affected succession and forest development. Furthermore, plants are specific to sediment depth and texture, as well as moisture and nutrient availability, which play important roles in their growth and development; thus, forest stands with contrasting species and age structures developed in the mudflow.@@@Edaphic conditions

Consequences for Seed Collections@@@@@@Received: 22 September 2004 Accepted: 31 March 2006 Published: 20 October 2006 Issue Date: January 2007@@@Reproductive phenology was observed over three years in a Eucalyptus grandis seed orchard in Madagascar to determine the impact of geographic differences of parental selections on the expected genetic composition of seed crops. Pollen flow (observed pollen cloud) was deduced from a paternity assignment based on sampling from one year’s seed production. The two approaches were used to verify whether knowledge of phenology is sufficient to predict the genetic quality of the seeds collected. Despite the high flowering level, with a constant cycle over three years, the results demonstrated wide reproductive phenological differences associated with the parents’ origin, suggesting putative pollination disequilibrium. From both observed and expected pollen clouds, the results showed preferential mating among different provenances, which has consequences for seed crop composition. Phenological observations, which can be made inexpensively, can be used to promote methods of effective seed orchard management in order to improve the genetic quality of seeds.@@@Seed orchard management

Climate change compounded with trends of rural abandonment are likely to diminish forested areas within the Mediterranean basin that will be replaced by fire prone shrub communities. This could be favoured by outbreaks of pathogens, fire and other large-scale disturbances. Landscape fragmentation is expected to impede species migration. Annual increments and subsequent income from forests are expected to decrease. Reafforestations are necessary to ensure the presence of propagules of forest species and their site-specific varieties best adapted to future climatic conditions even though they may be different from the present forest-plant community. Current challenges in biodiversity conservation can only be met by afforestations whose main objective is to maintain ecosystem functioning. A new silviculture must emerge encompassing these habitat displacement and economic concerns while maximizing carbon sequestration.@@@Global warming

The scarification treatments were not scarified control, mounding and soil inversion and the seedling types were a 10 week-old containerized seedling (mini seedling), a 2 year-old containerized seedling and a 2 year-old hybrid seedling, grown as a containerized seedling the first year and as a bare-root seedling the second year. Site preparation intensity had a greater effect on the mini seedlings. The results indicated that mini seedlings established faster in the soil inversion treatment compared to the larger seedling types. At the same seedling age, the mini seedlings had faster or similar growth rate as the containerized and the hybrid seedlings regardless of scarification treatment. Although mini seedlings grew as well as or even better than larger seedlings if they were successfully established, they were more sensitive to their planting environment and proper handling was critical. Problems with frost heaving and competing vegetation have to be taken into consideration when choosing site preparation method and seedling type.@@@Containerized seedling

Eight enzyme systems were studied. The genetic variation of the mature stand was higher than that of other stands reported in the literature. However, this level of genetic variation was not represented to the same extent by the seeds of the commercial harvest. Differences between the bud sample taken from the mature stand and the seed sample taken from the commercial subset were particularly obvious with respect to diversity measures and heterozygosities. The hypothetical gametic multilocus diversity (HGMD) of a bud sample of the mature Sorbus torminalis trees was more than 70% higher (94.1) than the value of the seed harvest sample (55.1). Deviations between the genetic structures of both samples were statistically significant. There is no indication that inbreeding is an essential component of the mating system of Sorbus torminalis. The potential causes for the lack of Sorbus torminalis seedlings and saplings originated from seeds and their consequences for regenerating this species are discussed. This research underscores that sampling a forest tree population for commercial harvest can result in a statistically significant reduction in the genetic diversity of the sampled group relative to the overall population.@@@Natural regeneration

BSP) is the most important commercial tree species in the eastern boreal forest of Canada. Only limited work has been conducted to assess the quality of the various substrates that are found on post-disturbed sites prone to paludification having an effect on black spruce seedling growth. The objectives of this study were (1) to use a pot test to assess black spruce seedling performance on substrates found at the soil surface, in the rooting zone of undisturbed soil, at depths that become available to spruce roots after soil disturbance by wildfire or through management; and (2) to determine the nutritional quality of these substrates when constraints of poor drainage are artificially removed. Black spruce growth was greatest with fibric Pleurozium in the rooting zone, and with burned fibric Pleurozium and living Sphagnum at the soil surface. Good seedling growth on different substrates found in the rooting zone was associated with higher N and P foliar concentrations. Based on these results, we recommend targeted planting of black spruce seedlings in substrates of Pleurozium origin and the development of management techniques that promote Pleurozium schreberi.@@@Black spruce seedlings

Seedlings from 20 P. patula provenances and 15 HE P. tecunumanii provenances were artificially inoculated with the pitch canker fungus at 21 and 12 weeks of age, respectively, and assessed for resistance 12–20 weeks later. There was important provenance variation in pitch canker resistance for both species. The 20-week LiveStem percentage ranged from 70.3% to 43.6% among the P. patula provenances and 59.6% to 11.7% among HE P. tecunumanii provenances. There was a geographic pattern to the provenance variation, and in both species, low altitude sources demonstrated more resistance than those from high elevation. Provenance variation in pitch canker resistance could be useful when making selection and breeding decisions with these species.@@@Tree diseases

Sprouting success, survival, number of sprouts per stump, and sprout height differed little between thinning treatments throughout the 5-year study period. Pre-harvest tree d.b.h. also had no influence on sprout survival and development. A 2-year drought reduced survival and may have influenced sprout development. Sprout clump survival dropped from 90% 1 year following thinning to 46% 3 years after thinning. Although sprout height averaged 337 cm 5 years after thinning, annual sprout growth decreased from 166 cm the first year after thinning to 33 cm in each of the last 2 growing seasons. Results indicated that bottomland hardwood regeneration evaluation models may underestimate the potential of oak stump sprouts to contribute to pre-harvest regeneration assessments. Further study in the role of stump sprouts to regenerate bottomland oak species is needed.@@@Quercus pagoda Raf.

Reforestation measures have been strongly recommended but may be hampered due to the very low seed germination reported for several Polylepis species. In order to facilitate reforestation we analysed the influence of seed mass on germination probability for Polylepis australis seeds in the Córdoba mountains (central Argentina). We collected seeds from 43 trees distributed throughout five woodland fragments located within two regions differing in size, topographical position, and altitude (1,900 m a.s.l. and 2,200 m a.s.l.). Seeds of Polylepis australis exhibited a great variation in terms of mass and percent seed germination among individual trees and among geographical regions. The results of logistic regression showed that germination probability was highly correlated with seed mass. However, the explained deviance significantly increased by including the region, the woodland fragment and especially the individual tree in addition to seed mass in the regression models. We conclude that selecting seeds on the basis of mass is an appropriate way to enhance germination prospects for reforestation projects. However, no absolute mass values are applicable in this context as the highest germination probabilities were reached at varying seed mass values depending on geographical region, woodland fragment or individual tree. We suggest collecting the relatively heaviest available seeds, even though the absolute seed mass may be low.@@@Argentina

The effect of aqueous smoke solution in overcoming the light requirement for germination, and the potential of visible (VIS) and near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy for sorting sound and insect-damaged seeds were also investigated. Highly significant differences in germination were detected among provenances (P < 0.0001) and stratification periods (P < 0.0001), but not between temperature regimes (P=0.111). Seeds from the south and southeast distribution ranges had higher percentage germination after 6 weeks of stratification than seeds collected from north, northwest and central ranges of distribution. The smoke treatment did not affect germination regardless of whether the seeds were exposed to light. Exposure to light increased germination capacity three fold. Sound and damaged seeds were distinguished with 90% accuracy using VIS + NIR spectroscopy. It can be concluded that dormancy in juniper seeds varies with provenances, and cold stratification for 6 weeks alleviates dormancy in some seed lots. Tentatively, smoke treatment seems ineffective in overcoming photo-dormancy in juniper seeds. VIS + NIR spectroscopy has demonstrated a great potential for sorting damaged seeds, thereby upgrading seed lot purity.@@@Dormancy

For most of the characteristics assessed there was no significant interaction between species and shade indicating that the morphological responses to changing shade treatments were not species-dependent. After two growing seasons the mean height increment for the three species was significantly greater in 25% (76.1 cm) and 50% shade (74.9 cm) than in the open (69.5 cm). Root collar diameter increment, shoot, root and total biomass declined significantly with increasing shade while the opposite was true for the height:diameter ratio. In both western red cedar and hybrid larch the shoot:root ratio was significantly greater in the shade while in Sitka spruce this characteristic was not influenced by shade. While all species had significantly greater specific shoot areas in 75% shade than in 0% shade, this trend was particularly pronounced in hybrid larch. In hybrid larch and western red cedar, the normalised specific projected shoot area increased significantly with increasing shade. The opposite trend was observed for Sitka spruce. We conclude that in the main the species studied demonstrated similar shade acclimation responses despite their reported differences in shade tolerance.@@@Shadehouses

The total test population had about 35,000 individuals from 362 families of 9 provenances and was divided into two portions, each serving as the base population for its appropriate seed-planning unit. For each population, various genetic parameters were estimated and individual breeding values were predicted. Combined-site estimates of individual, family, and within-family heritability ranged from 0.23 to 0.38, 0.77 to 0.84, and 0.17 to 0.29, respectively. Estimated coefficients of type-b genetic correlation were greater than 0.81, indicating little G × E interaction in this region. Provenance effects were large. Larch Hills and Inonoaklin River were the two superior provenances with an expected gain of 13% and 10% in stem volume at rotation age of 60 years in TOLO. Individual breeding values was not uniformly distributed among provenances and the top 100 individuals originated from 20 families in TOLO and 32 families in TOHI. Co-ancestry among these individuals should not be a serious concern in seed orchard establishment as the predicted genetic loss due to excessive inbreeding is only 1.06% in TOLO and 0.6% in TOHI. The status numbers of the two prospective seed orchards are 32 and 44, respectively, and both are well above the required minimum of 10 in British Columbia. Using unrelated clones for seed orchard establishment may result in reduced optimum genetic gain and thus is not a favourable option.@@@Interior lodgepole pine

The first aim of this study was to develop a reliable inoculation technique to screen Pinus spp., for tolerance to infection by F. circinatum, which threatens pine forestry in South Africa. Inoculation of branches was compared with stem inoculations and we considered the number of branches or trees required to obtain statistically significant results. Furthermore, variation in the susceptibility of some Pinus families, clones and hybrids was considered. Results showed that branch inoculations were closely correlated with those from stem inoculations, and that it is important to consider branch and stem diameters when assessing susceptibility of trees. Subsequent trials using branch inoculations showed significant differences in F. circinatum tolerance amongst a range of pine species and hybrids of potential interest to forestry in South Africa. Significant differences in susceptibility were also found among clones of two P. radiata families. The most tolerant trees were P. elliottii × caribaea and P. patula × oocarpa hybrids, while the most susceptible species were P. patula, P. greggii and hybrids of these two. This is the first trial considering the susceptibility of Pinus hybrids, Pinus clones and some P. patula provenances, and the results indicate excellent potential for breeding for tolerance to pitch canker in South Africa.

Application The accurate selection of disease tolerant planting stock for the South African forestry industry is crucially important for the continued sustainability of this important industry. The work described here provides valuable information on an artificial inoculation technique that will assist the industry in screening trees for tolerance to the pitch canker fungus, F. circinatum. It also provides some indication of the relative susceptibility of a number of Pinus spp., hybrids and families currently being evaluated in the country.@@@Forestry

(teak). Exogenous application of auxins, i.e., α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) has a significant positive effect on the percentage of rooting. The maximum percent rooting was obtained with 4,000 ppm IBA as compared to other treatment. Significant increase in root number was recorded in shoot cuttings treated with 4,000 ppm NAA. The overall rooting response was better in the treatment with IBA rather than with NAA. Further periodic samples (0, 10, 20, and 30 days) were taken to assess the total soluble sugar, starch, protein, and peroxidase (PER) activity in the rooting zone of shoot cuttings of teak during adventitious root formation. Application NAA and IBA to shoot cuttings resulted in an increase in the level of total soluble sugar, starch, protein, and PER-activity in the rooting zone. The stored carbohydrates were utilized during adventitious root formation. Hence, total soluble sugar and starch contents of cuttings, irrespective of age of donor plants, decreased with the passage of time in cuttings planted for rooting. Significant fluctuations were observed in the protein content of cuttings during the time of root induction. There was an increase in the protein content with the passage of time from the day of planting up to its 20th day, followed by a sharp decline in the protein content of cuttings at the 30th day of planting, irrespective of the age of donor plants or the treatment of cuttings with auxins. Irrespective of donor plant age, PER-activity in the cuttings increased from the day of their planting for rooting up to the 20th day, and then declined at its 30th day of planting. It was interesting to note that PER-activity remained higher at all stages in the cuttings of 2-month-old seedlings which rooted profusely as compared to the cuttings of 15- and 30-year-old donor plants those rooted poorly. This study suggested that the exogenously applied NAA and IBA at different concentration seems to activate sugar metabolism for release of energy, protein and PER-activity which are necessary for cellular division and differentiation during adventitious root primordium initiation or development in the rooting zone of shoot cuttings.@@@Cuttings

We aimed at examining tree and shrub species diversity and distribution in Uapaca kirkiana-dominated woodlands under three land tenure types; forest reserves, customary and leasehold land. The study was conducted at different forest sites within similar agroecological zone in southern Malawi. Study sites were located at a range of altitudes between 900 and 1,200 m a.s.l. Three circular plots each with 32.60 m radius were established at each study site to sample tree and shrub species composition, structure and distribution under three land tenure types. We found that forest reserves had higher species diversity with an average of 16 tree families, 27 genera and 34 species as compared to only 10 tree families, 6 genera and 6 species on customary forest lands. Comparisons of diameter at breast height size class distributions showed that customary land had significantly low numbers of small (5.0–10.0 cm) and very large (≥30 cm) diameter classes suggesting lower levels of regeneration and high rate of anthropogenic activities. The high species diversity and richness in forest reserves and leasehold land indicate high potential for protected lands to restore tree species diversity. It is concluded that levels of human activities as influenced by land tenure type reduce tree species diversity, composition and distribution at the different sites, and this confirms the hypothesis that open access lands are not compatible with conservation of tree and shrub species diversity because of high anthropogenic activities.@@@Anthropogenic activities

Light-saturated photosynthesis (A max) and light saturation estimates (LSE) reflected the species successional status with Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels, the pioneer species showing largest mean A max and LSE at 100% sunlight, whereas at 10% sunlight, it showed the lowest A max and LSE. At 22% sunlight, Cedrela odorata L., an intermediate successional species had greater A max and LSE than Mansonia altissima A. Chev., a non-pioneer light demander and T. superba. T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A max–mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F v/F m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species’ short-term acclimation to high or low light.

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (−3°C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.@@@Carbohydrate reserves

Mill.) is necessary to arrest the decline of many associated plants and animals, and the establishment of longleaf pine on much of its original range requires artificial regeneration and diligence. In central Louisiana, USA, two fertilization levels (No [NF] or Yes [F-36 kg/ha N and 40 kg/ha P]) in combination with three vegetation treatments (check, two prescribed fires [PF], or multi-year vegetation control by herbicidal and mechanical means [IVM]) were applied to container-grown longleaf pine plantings in two studies. In Study 1 (grass dominated), 6-year-old longleaf pine survival was 52% on the F–checks, 78% on the F–PF plots, and averaged 93% on the other four treatment combinations. Longleaf pine trees on the IVM plots (3.4 m) were significantly taller than on the other two vegetation treatments, and trees on the PF plots (1.8 m) were taller than trees on the check plots (1.2 m). In Study 2 (brush dominated), survival averaged 65% across the six-treatment combinations after 6 years. The longleaf pine trees were 4.7 m tall on the IVM plots and averaged 3.9 m tall on the check and PF plots. Fertilization increased P concentrations in the soil and longleaf pine foliage, while fertilization did not significantly affect longleaf pine height growth. Native fertility was not apparently limiting longleaf pine development contrary to prior research recommendations for these soils. In both studies, the IVM treatment reduced early herbaceous competition and the number and height of arborescent plants. The PF treatment reduced arborescent plant height on the grassy site where fires were more intense than on the brushy site.@@@Brown-spot needle blight

Exotic eucalyptus plantations in South America were most profitable, with internal rates of returns (IRRs) ranging from 13% to 23%, followed by exotic loblolly pine, with IRRs from 9% to 17%. Average loblolly pine plantation returns in the US South were less profitable, with an IRR of about 9.5%, and natural forest management in the South had IRRs of 4% to 8%. Subtropical native species plantations of the best araucaria and nothofagus species had reasonable financial returns, with IRRs ranging from 5% to 13%. Subtropical or tropical native forests had fewer commercial timber species, and had much lower growth rates and returns. Their IRRs were less than 4%, or even negative for unmanaged stands. State subsidy payments for forest plantations or for timber stand improvements increased IRRs somewhat and reserving areas for environmental protection reduced their IRRs slightly. Including land costs in the cash flows decreased these internal rates of return substantially. Natural stand returns in Latin America were much less than those of plantations, but management of those stands offered better rates of return than only holding the land.@@@Financial analyses

Newly emerged ponderosa pine seedlings were identified at the start of summer and were monitored through their second summer; a subsequent cohort of seedlings was identified and monitored for one summer. About 3% of the viable seed that was produced resulted in new seedlings. Mortality was substantial immediately following emergence. Most seedlings emerged without shading from understory vegetation, but few survived. Most seedlings alive after one year had emerged beneath live cover; by the end of two summers only shaded seedlings were alive. 63–85% of new seedlings initiated in clusters attributed to rodent caching, and seedlings originating in clusters remained a substantial proportion of the cohort (60%) after two seasons. Results suggest that understory vegetation in these types of stands facilitates the recruitment of ponderosa pine seedlings, most likely by buffering them against environmental stressors during the seedling establishment phase. They also reveal that seed caching rodents are highly active in seed redistribution and can exert a lasting influence on seedling recruitment.@@@Natural regeneration

Qualitative and quantitative changes in putrescine, spermidine, and spermine tissue contents, during the rooting process and their correlation with other biochemical markers and morphological changes, provided the rationale for their use during the study of a successive in vitro culture protocol for N. nervosa, as well as the use of their inhibitors. The polyamine tissue content was maximum before root emergence (spermine raised to 100 nmol/g FW to later decreased to ca. 50 nmol/g FW in the following days), but it was lower in improved rooting media (197 nmol/g FW compared to 264 nmol/g FW of the control medium). It was concluded that polyamines qualitatively and quantitatively improve in vitro rhizogenesis, and the best successive culture media included 10 μM spermine during the expression phase.@@@Rooting markers

Explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with BAP, NAA and 2,4-D (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg l−1) alone, and BAP (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg l−1) in combination with 2,4-D or NAA (0.2 and 0.5 mg l−1). After 4 weeks in culture, up to 60% of cotyledonary explants from the seeds stored for <3 months produced direct somatic embryos on BAP (0.5–4.0 mg l−1) in combination with 2,4-D (0.2 mg l−1). The number of somatic embryos ranged from 5 to 14 per explant in BAP (0.5 mg l−1) and 2,4-D (0.2 mg l−1) combination. Only 20% of cotyledonary explants from seeds stored for >12 months produced somatic embryos. Mature zygotic embryos failed to produce any somatic embryos. Subcultures of somatic embryos from cotyledonary explants of seeds stored for <3 months formed clusters of shootlets on semi solid MS and 1/2 MS media. After 6 weeks of subculture on multiplication MS media augmented with BAP (0.5 mg l−1) and IAA (0.2 mg l−1), 70% of the shoot tips formed 4–7 shoots per explant.

Engelm.) crosses, white spruce (P. glauca (Moench) Voss) crosses, or a mixture. Each genotype was measured for morphological attributes: height, diameter, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, shoot-to-root ratio, height-to-diameter ratio at time of lifting. Each genotype was also measured for physiological attributes of cuticular transpiration (TFDcut), osmotic potential at turgor loss point (Ψtlp) and freezing tolerance (index of injury at −6°C and −4°C; II@−6 & II@−4) during inactive and active shoot growth phases. Shoot growth potential (SGP = length of new leader elongation) and root growth potential (RGP) were conducted under four environmental regimes: nutrient-rich/well-watered, nutrient-poor/well-watered, low root temperature, and planting stress conditions. The somatic seedlot met target height, diameter and RGP standards for a plantable seedling crop in British Columbia, Canada, though genotypes differed in morphology at time of lifting. These genotypes also differed in their measured physiological attributes (TFDcut, Ψtlp, II@−6 and II@−4) at time of lifting and during active shoot growth. Genotypic differences were also found for SGP and RGP under different testing environments.

(Rubiaceae) is a late successional neotropical fruit tree used in riparian forest restoration programs. We analyze the effects of light availability and soil flooding on the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of G. americana seedlings under nursery and natural light conditions. Two light levels (full sunlight and shade), and two levels of soil water (flooded and control) were used in the experiment. Flooding induced significant changes in the total seedling biomass (P < 0.01). The differences among water treatments were 70 and 10% at full sunlight and shade, respectively. These changes were explained by alterations in the maximum quantum efficiency of the photosystem 2 (Fv/Fm), light-saturated net photosynthetic rates (A sat) and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE). G. americana has high physiological plasticity in relation to the light availability and flooding, although significant interactive effects between high light exposure and soil flooding were observed in several photosynthetic and growth variables. The results highlight the importance of the synergistic effects between physical environmental variables on the establishment and growth of G. americana seedlings. In the practical point of view we can indicate that, in degraded riparian forests subjected to soil flooding, seedlings of this species should be planted under partially shaded environments.@@@Brazilian Atlantic rainforest

This study compares road track and roadside regeneration with regeneration in unlogged and selectively logged humid tropical forest in north-eastern Bolivia. Some species benefited from increased light intensities on abandoned logging roads. Others benefited from low densities of competing vegetation on roads with compacted soils. This was the case for the small-seeded species Ficus boliviana C.C. Berg and Terminalia oblonga (Ruiz & Pav.) Steud. Some species, e.g. Hura crepitans L., displayed patchy regeneration coinciding with the presence of adult trees. Our results suggest that current management practices could be improved by intensifying logging in some areas to improve regeneration of light demanding species. Sufficient seed input in logged areas should be ensured by interspersing large patches of unlogged forest with logged areas. This may also assist regeneration of species that perform poorly in disturbed areas.@@@Bolivia

In volcanic areas, tephra deposition can be a major disturbance that eliminates vegetation cover and creates a barrier for plant establishment. The eruption of the Paricutín volcano, in Michoacán, México, from 1943 to 1952, created large tephra deposits adjacent to forest stands. Many of these deposits still lack native vegetation and understanding of the limiting factors for establishment of native tree species is necessary to restore these areas. Pinus pseudostrobus early growth in response to the amount of fertile growing medium on top of a variable-depth tephra layer was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. Increasing amounts of fertile growing medium increased height of 28-week-old plants (no growing medium = 5.5 cm tall ±1.8 cm, 3 cm of growing medium = 21.2 ± 4.6 cm and 6 cm of growing medium 24.8 ± 4.4 cm). Other variables showed the same trend (diameter, number of fascicles, belowground biomass and aboveground biomass). Our results suggest that P. pseudostrobus establishment in tephra covered areas will depend on the accumulation of a fertile layer of more than 3 cm in thickness.@@@Restoration

Our objectives were to determine nutrient ratios of common hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. and Gray × Populus deltoides Marsh.) (T × D) clones under steady-state nutrition, and to determine if incremental additions of fertilizer were more successful than conventional (evenly-split) fertilizer additions in maximizing biomass production and inducing stable nutrient ratios. Un-rooted cuttings of three T × D clones (49–177, DTAC-7, 15–29) were grown under a conventional regime and a modified-exponential fertilization regime at three application rates (1.8, 3.7 or 7.4 g N plant−1). Above- and below-ground biomass and nutrient concentrations were measured after one growing season. There were few differences in total plant biomass between conventional and modified-exponential fertilization regimes, but for one clone, biomass accumulation equivalent to the highest rate under the conventional regime was achieved with the medium rate of the modified-exponential regime. Stable nutrient ratios (at conditions consistent with steady-state nutrition) were: 100N:14P:50K (49–177), 100N:13P:49K (DTAC-7) and 100N:12P:60K (15–29).@@@Populus trichocarpa × Populus deltoides

In order to identify suitable herbicides, two container experiments tested the response of 12 broadleaved tree and shrub species to napropamide and pendimethalin applied preemergence. Most species tolerated rates adequate for controlling many annual weed species although Rhamnus cathartica L. (buckthorn) and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (alder) were damaged by all rates of napropamide. A study of application date of napropamide and pendimethalin applied post-sowing to Fraxinus excelsior L. (ash) in containers showed that pendimethalin was damaging if applied when seeds were germinating or seedlings emerging, but napropamide was tolerated at all growth stages. A field experiment tested the tolerance of ten species sown in seedbeds to napropamide alone and in mixture with pendimethalin. Results generally confirmed the indications of tolerance from the container experiments. Applications of 2 kg a.i. ha−1 napropamide plus 2 kg a.i. ha−1 pendimethalin appeared to be safe on Corylus avellana L. (hazel), Fagus sylvatica L. (beech), and F. excelsior, provided tree seeds were sown to the correct depth and at least 2 weeks elapsed between herbicide treatment and tree seed germination. The mixture of 2 kg a.i. ha−1 pendimethalin plus 1.0 kg a.i. ha−1 of napropamide was tolerated by Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore) and Crataegus monogyna Jacq. (hawthorn).

Under each population, 20 mother trees of different ages (30 to more than 100 years) were selected which were at least 50 m apart. From each tree, eight seeds were assayed for eleven enzyme systems viz., Aconitase, Aspertate aminotransferase, Glutamate dehydrogenase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase, Leucine-amino peptidase, Malate dehydrogenase, Menadione reductase, Phosphoglucose isomerase, Phosphoglucomutase, 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and Shikimic acid dehdrogenase which were found to be encoded by 18 polymorphic loci. Genetic constitution of the mother trees was determined by analysing endosperms and embryos separately. The number of alleles in the progeny (embryos) and the mother trees varied from 38 to 42 and 34 to 37, respectively, in all the populations. Distribution of degree of heterozygosity and fixation index for the progeny and the mother trees were calculated. The mother trees showed a substantial shift towards higher degree of heterozygosity as compared to the progeny. Fixation index values were significantly higher and negative for the mother trees as compared to the progeny, which revealed that heterozygosity was positively correlated with survival in P. roxburghii.@@@Pinus roxburghii

Currently, this is served by maintaining genetic diversity while capturing genetic improvement, often through structuring populations into a genetic hierarchy, setting population sizes, and managing pedigrees and inbreeding. In the future, information from genomic technologies will complement classical approaches, such as common-garden field experiments, for characterizing the genetic base and measuring and monitoring genetic diversity. This will entail directly measuring DNA sequence diversity of both selectively neutral markers and functional genes. Calibrating neutral marker diversity against functional diversity will become easier with functional genomics. For maintaining pedigree and managing inbreeding, genomic information can be used to relax some traditional tenets of population management. With future knowledge of functional polymorphisms, the better understanding of the nature and origins of genetic variation should enhance management of populations to both conserve genetic diversity and exploit it by more efficient selection. Where fungal diseases threaten biotic crises, very large populations may be needed, the requisite sizes often being very uncertain. Gene discovery holds enormous promise, but depends heavily on comparative genomics, capitalizing on genomic information from Arabidopsis, Populus and Eucalyptus, and the increasing numbers of accessible ESTs. Much greater insights into non-codon mutational processes and rates should also guide population management. A key challenge, however, will be to utilize information and apply tools cost-effectively. Also, very detailed genomic information, exemplified by the poplar-genome sequencing, may allow earlier adaptation of technology and development of new information in angiosperms than in gymnosperms.@@@Tree breeding

Sixty seedlings of each stock type were planted on a clearfell and weed-free site near Restoule, Ontario. Twenty-four additional seedlings from each stock type were compared at the start of the study in terms of shoot and root parameters. Measurement of root and shoot parameters were repeated at three dates during the first growing season in the field. The root systems of container stock had a larger number of first order lateral long roots and were significantly more fibrous than bare-root stock. These differences were sustained throughout the first growing season. In terms of field performance, container seedlings had 100% survival and achieved significant increases in both biomass and shoot extension. Bare-root seedlings suffered 25% mortality, significant shoot dieback and more variable growth. The mean relative growth rate (RGR) of container seedlings increased throughout the study period to a maximum of 30 mg/g/day, whereas the mean RGR of bare-root stock remained close to or below zero. Overall, the container seedlings proved less prone to transplanting shock than the bare-root seedlings, most likely due to favourable root architecture and the pattern of root development. Further work may be warranted in container design, growing regimes and root architecture to fully realise the potential of container systems for the production of high quality red oak seedlings across a range of site conditions.@@@Root regeneration

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of ripping on soil chemical and physical properties, on free-to-grow status, and on survival and growth of planted shortleaf pine seedlings. After 16 years, ripping increased exchangeable calcium; however, it had no long-term effects on soil particle size, organic carbon, pH, exchangeable potassium and exchangeable magnesium. Ripping increased the percentage of free-to-grow saplings by 3.8% after two growing seasons. Ripping improved survival by 4% during the 1st three growing seasons and by 7.1% at age 16. After two growing seasons, ripping improved crown spread by 13.6%, height by 14.2%, diameter by 14%, and volume by 41.2%. At age 16, ripping no longer had an effect on shortleaf pine height and had reduced diameter by 5.3% and volume by 11.0%. Our results suggest that ripping 1) had no effect on long-term physical properties or chemical properties of the soil, 2) had no effect on the number of free-to-grow seedlings, and 3) produced short-term benefits on survival and growth of planted shortleaf pine.@@@Soil physical properties

The SDCD is primarily used to derive density control schedules by management objectives. The main objectives of the present study are to define a modified model of SDCD for application to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) plantations in Bulgaria, to examine the fitness of the model with representative experimental data sets from plantations of both species and to present a way of direct application of the SDCDs for practical purposes. The constructed SDCDs characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of the pine plantations in a broad range of densities, forest sites and growth stages from 4 to 26 (28) m of dominant height class. The full density lines were fixed with self-thinning exponents α = 1.69 and α = 1.75 for Scots pine and Austrian black pine, respectively, and the trajectories of natural thinning for 23 initial densities (444-40000/ha) were determined. A direct way for application of the SDCDs to the plantation management was designed to estimate the optimal initial densities for the maximum attainable final yield and large-size wood production by self-thinning stands.@@@Natural thinning trajectory

A total 2,166 viable seeds were collected between 2 September 1999 and 6 June 2000. Total seed quantities varied more by site than by tree density, with the xeric site producing six-fold greater seed yields. Within each site, the stand of higher density produced more viable seed. Per-tree cone yields were also greater at the site of lesser productivity. At three of the four stands, tree fecundity (as measured by cone counts) was positively related to diameter at breast height and height, but not to live crown ratio. A difference in temporal seedfall patterns among the two sites occurred late and was relatively minor: most seedfall occurred within the first month after it started regardless of absolute seed production. Seedfall distribution varied spatially within stands, but no seed trap (of 55) received less than an equivalent 28 thousand seeds per hectare.

The von Bertalanffy’s growth model and 59, 0.1 ha plots (0.55–9.55 years old) were used to develop site index (SI) curves at 6 years base age. Then, using the state-space approach, stand growth and yield models were developed for basal area, volume and biomass. The results show that A. mangium is a very promising species for timber production, atmospheric carbon removal and soil restoration because it grows very fast even in mining degraded soils. On average sites it reaches 15 m in height in 3 years. However, early and reiterated thinning coupled with initial mortality by cattle invasion of the very young understocked plantations are producing relatively low yields.@@@Acacia mangium

This study aimed at upgrading the germination performance by removing non-germinable seeds using petroleum flotation technique. Seeds collected from 19 individual trees in seedling seed orchards in India were assessed using X-ray to determine the proportion of different seed lot fractions. The feasibility of petroleum ether as a separation medium was tested. Morphological characters of floating and sunken seeds were further studied using image analysis technique to examine their effects on the separation efficiency. The X-ray analysis revealed a large quantity of shrivelled, empty and insect-damaged seeds, altogether accounting 50%, which were the causes of low percentage germination of un-graded seed lots (48%). Petroleum flotation resulted in 90% germination in the sunken fraction and 4% in the floating fraction. The separation was distinct for most seed lots, except few seed lots that had relatively low germination in the sunken fractions and more than 10% germination in the floating fractions. As a whole, petroleum flotation appears to be a feasible technique to upgrade the germination of C. equisetifolia seed lots, and its efficacy is influenced by wing surface area, seed density and wing quotient of filled and empty seeds.@@@Empty seeds

To help find methods to increase rate and percentage of germination, we investigated its seed germination responses by using several collections and pre-treatments. Seeds processed from 6-week old green fruits did not germinate, whilst those of 10-week old partly-mature, at the intermediate stage through full development, germinated 46%. Seeds from orange mature fruits reached maximum 54–62% germination. Radicles emerged 6 weeks after sowing and normal germination with emergence of the primary single shoot growth occurred after 12 weeks. There was no significant difference (P ≥ 0.05) between germination responses of seeds from Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. Seeds did not germinate when dried to below ca. 30% MC. De-coating seeds or soaking intact seeds in a 70% ethanol solution increased germination to 82–92%, and also increased germination rate; however germination was not uniform. Because difficulties in germinating these seeds stem from the physical presence of the seed coats and the slow growth of the embryos contained therein, we recommend that fresh seeds from mature fruits be de-coated and immediately sown in preferably, an aerated medium (e.g., sawdust) for cultivation.@@@Garcinia kola

B.S.P.). Seedlings were grown from seed with a conventional, fixed dose fertilizer (10 mg N seedling−1) or an exponential nutrient loading regime (75 mg N seedling−1). The following spring, seedlings were exposed for two weeks to either ambient (370 ppm) or elevated levels of CO2 (800 ppm) and then planted in the field; seedling growth was followed for the next six years. Exponential nutrient loading increased seedling height, stem diameter and leader growth, with the largest increases in height and leader length occurring in the first three years after outplanting. Carbon loading increased seedling height and leader length, but only in seedlings that had been exponentially nutrient loaded. A combination of carbon and nutrient loading increased shoot height 26%, stem diameter 37% and leader length 40% over trees that received neither treatment. These results demonstrate that the growth enhancement seen under exponential nutrient loading is maintained under field conditions for at least six years. Carbon loading just before outplanting was a useful supplement to nutrient loading, but was ineffective in the absence of nutrient loading.@@@Nitrogen

"353","Growth, carbon sequestration, and management of native tree plantations in humid regions of Costa Rica@@@@@@Received: 22 May 2006 Accepted: 09 February 2007 Published: 03 April 2007 Issue Date: November 2007@@@The Costa Rican government has provided incentives for reforestation programs since 1986 and initiated a Payment for Environmental Services program in 1996. These incentives yielded native species reforestation programs throughout the country. This research aims to provide information about growth, carbon sequestration, and management of seven native tree species (Vochysia guatemalensis, Vochysia ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Calophyllum brasiliense, Terminalia amazonia, Virola koschnyi, and Dipteryx panamensis) growing in small and medium-sized plantations in the Caribbean and Northern lowlands of Costa Rica. A total of 179 plots were evaluated in 32 farms. Overall, I found that V. guatemalensis, V. ferruginea, H. alchorneoides, and T. amazonia were the species with the fastest diameter, total height, and volume growth; and T. amazonia and D. panamensis sequestered more carbon. Moreover, I found that the plantations that had been thinned before this assessment had the best growth. The results of the present research enhance the criteria elaborated in previous research findings to improve species choices for reforestation and silvicultural management in Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological features. Furthermore, they support the concept that tropical plantations can serve diverse economic, social, and ecological functions that may ultimately help reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation.@@@Productivity

We compared three tests of performance potential using container-grown seedlings of Douglas-fir, interior spruce, lodgepole pine, and western larch (14 seedlots total). On several autumn dates, seedlings were lifted and stored at −2°C. The following spring we tested stored seedlings for root growth potential (RGP), chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), and stomatal conductance (Gs), and then planted seedlings in nursery beds. We assessed survival and shoot dry weight (SDW) after one growing season. Performance test results were significantly correlated with each other (r ≥ 0.47) but showed different relationships with field performance, which varied with lift date. The best performance predictor was the sum of CF and RGP (R 2 = 0.79 for 78 seedlot by lift-date combinations), which minimized the risk of planting poor seedlings and not planting good seedlings. A sum of 83 for CF (Fv/Fm %) and RGP (new roots >1 cm) provided a threshold above which survival and growth were good. For evergreen conifers, Gs was a good performance predictor, but required extra time to measure leaf area. We recommend a combination of CF and RGP to assess vigor of shoot and root systems before planting.@@@Stock quality

"355","Effect of branch position and auxin treatment on clonal propagation of Tectona grandis Linn. f.@@@@@@Received: 05 January 2006 Accepted: 08 March 2007 Published: 26 April 2007 Issue Date: November 2007@@@The main objective of our clonal propagation program is the production of high quality timber and faster tree growth. Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) is an important plantation species in the tropics but the demand of teak timber is increasing globally. Teak planting stock is still produced from seeds of unselected elite genotypes which may lead to poor stand establishment. The number of seeds per fruit and their germination ability are also variable and limited by several factors. Therefore an alternative method i.e., clonal propagation is required for mass multiplication of elite trees. It is an established fact that the clonal propagation or adventitious root formation in cuttings is markedly affected by several external and internal factors. Considering these, an experiment was conducted on leafy soft wood shoot cuttings of 3-year-old hedged teak stock plants grown in a hedge garden to study the effects of branch position and auxin treatment on adventitious root formation. A factorial completely randomized design was used for experimentation. Coppice shoots were collected from basal, middle and upper positions of the hedge garden; and mono-nodal leafy cuttings were prepared. These cuttings were treated with different concentrations of IBA and NAA; and were cultured in a mist chamber for rooting where the relative humidity was maintained at 85 ± 2% with maximum and minimum day-night temperature at 32 ± 1°C and 26 ± 1°C respectively. After 45 days the cuttings were removed from the rooting medium and observations were made. It was observed that the rooting parameters viz., percent rooting and percent sprouting, mean number of leaves, mean number of shoots and length, and mean number of roots and length per cutting were significantly influenced by the branch position and auxin treatment. Treatment with 4000 ppm IBA increased percent rooting and percent sprouting whereas NAA suppressed it. Treatment with 4000 ppm IBA also increased the mean number of leaves and shoots, and the length, and the mean number of roots per cutting. The highest mean number of roots and length were observed in cuttings taken from the branch emerging at the upper position followed by branches of middle and lower position. Cuttings of branches at a middle position showed the highest values of percent rooting, percent sprouting, mean number of leaves and shoots and mean shoot length per cutting. Furthermore, the interactive effect of branch position and auxin treatment on rooting and sprouting response was also found to be significant. Overall, the findings of this investigation suggest that middle branch position in hedge plants and 4000 ppm IBA can be made to induce maximum rooting and to produce high quality planting stock material for clonal forestry program of teak.@@@Adventitious rooting

The main objective of this study was to identify germplasm sources of A. senegal that have a good seed germination capacity and seedling traits suitable for reforestation in the clay-soil part of the dryland gum belt in the Blue Nile region in Sudan. A specific objective was to tentatively explore the adaptive strategy of A. senegal populations. Seventeen-week-old seedlings were planted in the field at spacing of 3 m × 3 m, giving 100 trees per plot and replication; within a randomized complete block design with four replications. The experimental site was in the clay plain region. Seed variables showed significant differences. Clay plain provenances showed considerable variation in seed weight and seed number. They had the smallest seed weight but the highest seed number, while the sand (western) provenances had the largest seed weight but lowest seed number. Seedling branch number, root length, root to shoot ratio and shoot dry weight differed significantly among the provenances 12 weeks after germination. Clay provenances had the highest branch number and shoot dry weight but the shortest roots and lowest root to shoot ratio. This was interpreted as showing better adaptation to the site in these local provenances in comparison to those originating from the western sandy soil regions. High positive correlations were observed between seedling variables, such as root nodule and branch numbers; this could be used for early selection. The variation was greater between provenance groups than within them, suggesting that especially selection among groups would yield genetic gain.@@@Agroforestry

The gradient was created by applying various levels of midstory removal to fifty 0.05 ha areas located within a mixed-hardwood riparian forest corridor. Twelve yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) containerized seedling pairs were underplanted within each area. Canopy closure was estimated using hemispherical photography; height-to-canopy and basal area were recorded at each seedling pair. Survival, basal diameter, and height were monitored through two growing seasons. Species-specific mortality and height growth models were developed for one and two growing seasons following underplanting. The interaction of height-to-canopy and basal area along with canopy closure were found to be the most strongly related to mortality. Height to the forest canopy and initial seedling size explained the most variance in height increment. Although the height increment models possess limited predictive power (R2 range from 0.22 to 0.36), both mortality and growth analyses emphasize the importance of quantifying vertical canopy structure, along with the more commonly considered horizontal measures of forest structure (basal area and stem density), when evaluating seedling development beneath a forest canopy.@@@Forest structure

This study examines the effects of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii) and aspen (Populus tremuloides) regeneration mechanisms on sucker and seedling spatial patterns, distance from adult trees, and density in encroaching forests. A total of 8,924 aspen suckers and 1,244 Douglas-fir seedlings were counted and mapped in 2,920 quadrats (5 m × 5 m) in 106 plots along a lower forest-grassland ecotone in the Centennial Valley, MT, USA. Sucker and seedling spatial patterns were analyzed using Morisita’s I index. Average sucker and seedling density per quadrat and distance from adult trees were estimated for each plot and compared between aspen-dominated plots and Douglas-fir-dominated plots using ANOVA tests. Aspen suckers were established in a clustered spatial pattern at a significantly higher density and a significantly shorter distance from the adult trees. In contrast, Douglas-fir seedlings were established in varying spatial patterns at a significantly lower density and a significantly greater distance from the adult trees. Forest encroachment into the adjacent grassland in the Centennial Valley is occurring in contrasting patterns and at varying rates and densities due to the difference in aspen and Douglas-fir regeneration mechanisms.@@@Ecotone shift

Karst.). During the early regeneration phase however, seedling mortality may be high, so it is important to study how different combinations of stand-level treatments and site preparation methods affect seedling establishment. We studied emergence, 1st winter and 2nd summer mortality for naturally regenerated spruce seedlings in a field experiment that combined four harvest treatments (shelterwoods of high (SH), medium (SM) and low (SL) residual basal area, and a 50 × 50 m clear-cut (CC)) and two site preparation methods (patch scarification and inverting). The CC had significantly fewer seedlings the 1st fall than the SL and SH (p = 0.0377), and in all harvest treatments, fewer seedlings emerged in inverted than in patch scarified spots (p = 0.0351). Mortality was also lower with patch scarification than inverting (1st winter: p = 0.0565, 2nd summer: p = 0.0377), but was not affected by harvest treatment (1st winter: p = 0.9211, 2nd summer: p = 0.1896). On average, mortality from 1st to 2nd fall reached 38% and 27% after inverting and patch scarification, respectively. First winter mortality accounted for approximately two thirds of the accumulated mortality, regardless of the harvest treatment and site preparation method.@@@Group felling

Hook. f. ex K. Shum. is an important timber-tree species in the Peruvian Amazon Basin. Markets currently prefer wood with a uniform, light yellow color, but these preferences may change in the future. As farmers and industry commonly use wood from young trees, it is important to investigate genetic and environmental variation in juvenile-wood properties to assess whether tree improvement programs could make adjustments to changing preferences. A provenance/progeny test was established to evaluate genetic variation in growth and wood properties of young trees, the strength of their genetic control as well as their interrelationships both at the genetic and the phenotypic level in different planting zones. This paper presents analyses of variation in wood color at 39 months, and their correlations with tree growth and wood basic density. CIELab means for lightness ranging from black to white (L), green to red hues (a*) and blue to yellow hues (b*) were 67.63, 5.34 and 22.12, respectively; means for chroma (C) and hue angle (h)* were 22.76 and 76.43, respectively (C and h* were estimated from a* and b*). Significant variation due to provenances and especially due to families within provenances was found in some wood color characteristics, and some color characteristics also differed significantly among planting zones. Genetic correlations indicate that, in general, selection of faster growing trees and/or trees with denser wood would have little effect on wood color and its uniformity. In general, wood color had relatively low heritability (h 2i ): among all trees, h 2i = 0.31 for L; and variance due to families was not significant for a* and b*. Genetic control of color was highest in the planting zone where trees grew most rapidly: h 2i = 0.48 and 0.52 for a* and b*, respectively; but variance due to families was not significant for L. Results suggest that selection based on wood color would be more effective in zones with more fertile soils and higher rainfall.@@@Provenance

Don populations in northern Thailand: analysis of a rehabilitated site and adjacent intact forest@@@@@@Received: 28 September 2006 Accepted: 10 June 2007 Published: 05 July 2007 Issue Date: January 2008@@@This study describes the level of genetic variation and gene flow within and among populations of Prunus cerasoides in rehabilitated sites and adjacent intact forest. The seven microsatellite loci employed detected a total of 75 alleles (n = 401). Polymorphic information content (PIC) varied from 0.34 to 0.83. Between the adult populations there was moderate genetic differentiation with an F ST value of 0.0575, which suggests that the restoration plots had a similar genetic composition to that of the natural population. The gene flow assessment provides some interesting insights into the genetic diversity of P. cerasoides. In the 16 naturally occurring trees over 83% of the genotyped seed were fathered by unidentified trees whereas in restoration plot A only about 32% of the pollen came from an unidentified father. This proportion was even less in Plot C where 25% of the pollen parents were unidentified. The naturally occurring trees within Doi Suthep were surrounded by planted trees, which were contributing to the paternity of the seed crop. This result demonstrates that ‘‘fill in’’ planting should consist of locally sourced material if it is considered important to conserve the genetic integrity of the local populations.@@@Forest restoration

The objective of this research is to study their seed germination and seedling growth to develop simple methods for seedling production in small scale nurseries. Because the species have distinct dormancy and germination characteristics, the seeds were submitted to different treatments. D. jorgei seeds were immersed in hot water, scarified and stored for 12 weeks in the laboratory environment (25°C). S. macrostachya seeds were submitted to different combinations of drying and storage in the laboratory environment or refrigerator (4°C). Seedlings were submitted to two light treatments for 3 months: partial shade (52% of full sun) and full shade (12% of full sun). In D. jorgei, the highest germination occurred for scarified seeds (87%) and for seeds stored for 12 weeks and then scarified (69%). In S. macrostachya the undried control seeds had the highest germination, followed by that of the refrigeration storage treatment, without predrying (99% and 97%, respectively). The average values for the growth parameters were greater in full shade for D. jorgei, while S. macrostachya seedlings showed greater growth rates in partial shade. Two months growth is recommended before D. jorgei seedlings are of the sufficient size and leaf number for field planting. On the other hand, a period of 4 months is recommended for S. macrostachya, due to its relatively slow growth.@@@Brazilian Atlantic rainforest

In the field study performed in Kushiro Mire, Hokkaido Island, Japan, tree heights and stem diameters decreased with an increase in water depth accompanied with the reduction of soil redox potential. In contrast, the rate of multiple stems per individual tree increased. In the controlled experiments for seedlings flooding suppressed the shoot elongation and biomass increment in roots. However, diameter increment around water levels, epicormic shoot development and adventitious root formation were enhanced in flooded seedlings. The photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of flooded seedlings also were lowered with an increase in flooding depth. The recovery of the reduced photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance occurred simultaneously with the advancement of adventitious root formation in the flooded seedlings. These results indicate the importance of a series of morphological changes occurring on stems around water levels in flood tolerance in A. japonica species.@@@Adventitious roots

Each site was separated into two areas that were site-prepared by either ripping or mounding. When seedlings reached a height of about 20 cm under normal greenhouse growth conditions, the seedlings from different germination dates over a 7-week period were exposed to one of five different conditioning treatments (T), mainly through varying the duration of 12-h short-day exposure to 0 (T0), 3 (T3), 7 (T7), 10 (T10), or 15 (T15) days followed by different periods of reduced N supply. N-reduction produced few differences in needle nutrient concentrations and so was not considered a likely cause of differences in field performance. The treatments progressively (from T0 to T15) increased tolerance to drought and frost, and resulted in a similar seedling size for T3, T7 and T10 (planting height of 21 cm and ground diameter of 2.9 mm) although T0 seedlings were smaller (20 cm) and T15 taller (24 cm). The weather in 1999 was dry, particularly in the weeks immediately before and after planting, but relatively moist and favorable in 2000 and 2001 apart from one major frost event (−7°C) in May 2000. Survival, growth and needle damage varied substantially among sites and short-day treatments, and the treatment differences were largely consistent across the four sites. In general the growth was better on the ripped than on the mounded areas. Seedlings in T7 (intermediate tolerance) survived and grew best in the first year but T0 (actively growing) did best during the second year. After 2 years, no differences were observed among T0, T3 and T7 in mortality (18%) and total height growth (15 cm). However, T10 and T15 had higher mortality (24 and 43%), and lower height growth (12 and 10 cm, respectively). The percentage of seedlings showing very severe needle damage after 2 years increased from T0 through T15 (14–33%). New root egress in the field also differed significantly among treatments and was positively and highly correlated with survival rate and growth. These results suggest that a longer short-day regime, as in T10 or T15, may be counterproductive and a shorter regime may be more effective in improving the performance of summer-planted white spruce seedlings.@@@Growth

The simulator can predict growth dynamics for coniferous crop trees as well as competing hardwoods and shrubs. Model specification included conifer, shrub, and hardwood competition expressed at the plot-level. The system employs water-holding capacity as an indicator of productivity. Growth data were obtained from 109 plantations, ranging in age from 3 to 25, in southern Oregon and northern California. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco), the most common conifer species, was observed in 80 of the sampled stands. These observations were used for model development of the primary driving functions, which forecast 2-year basal diameter increment, height increment, and crown width increment. Parameters for all three dynamic expressions for growth were estimated using weighted, nonlinear three-stage least squares. This estimation method provided a predictive model with slight improvements in standard errors for two of the three equations (an average of 3% for height and diameter growth) and no improvement for crown width, when compared with two-stage least squares. The system includes competition from shrubs and hardwoods in predictions of height growth, diameter growth and crown width increment. This allows individual-tree/distance-independent simulator architecture to be extended to young plantations in southern Oregon and northern California.@@@Growth modeling

The longer the seed orchard is active, the more genetically outdated the produced seeds will become, and thus their value will decline with time. A main scenario was constructed using the best available estimates for Swedish Norway spruce and was compared to various alternatives reflecting likely variations. The optimal lifetimes in all of these scenarios was in the order of 40 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that use of orchards for slightly more or less than their optimal lifetimes does not lead to large losses. A more effective tree breeding program could slightly reduce the optimal lifetimes. The optimal lifetime depends strongly on the relationship between monetary value and genetic gain. Thus, in cases where genetic progress is sufficiently rapid, the optimal lifetime may be less than 30 years.@@@Norway spruce

Information about the genetic composition of eastern hemlock is necessary to guide ex situ conservation efforts in the southeastern United States, where the species is expected to harbor relatively high amounts of genetic variation in areas of Pleistocene glacial refuge. Nineteen allozyme markers were used to quantify the genetic variation present in 20 eastern hemlock populations in the southeastern United States. Results indicate that the species has low levels of genetic diversity in the region compared to most other conifers, but greater population differentiation (F ST = 0.126). Populations along the eastern periphery and in the Appalachian interior exhibited higher levels of diversity than those along the western periphery of its geographic range. The results suggest that the glacial refuge area for eastern hemlock was likely located east of the southern Appalachian Mountains, and indicate that ex situ conservation seed collections should be concentrated in these areas of higher diversity.@@@Genetic diversity

Don to ectomycorrhizal inoculation@@@@@@Received: 19 October 2006 Accepted: 14 June 2007 Published: 10 October 2007 Issue Date: March 2008@@@Australian acacias like Acacia holosericea are excellent candidates for the revegetation of arid zones in Africa. Their high ability to develop multiple symbioses with soil microorganisms is crucial to their rapid development in adverse climatic and edaphic conditions. These symbioses include nitrogen fixation with rhizobia, vesicular arbuscular mycorrhization and ectomycorrhization. We set up an experiment to test the growth response of A. holosericea to ectomycorrhizal inoculation in 13 different soils from Senegal. After autoclaving the soil, the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse for four weeks. Plants were inoculated with Pisolithus albus strain IR100. The following parameters were measured: plant biomass, N, P, K and Ca foliar composition, spontaneous nodulation rate, and ectomycorrhizal colonization. Data were analyzed in light of the physical, chemical and total microbial characteristics of the soil. The results demonstrated a global promoting effect of P. albus inoculation on plant (shoot and root) growth and on foliar P and K, together with a depressive effect on N, while Ca rates were barely affected. Interestingly, spontaneous nodulation with putative water- or airborne rhizobia was stimulated after P. albus inoculation. However, these nodules seemed poorly effective, as they failed to cause any change in plant growth or in foliar N composition within the nodulated and nonnodulated control plants. These results show that plant growth response to ectomycorrhizal inoculation is greatly dependent on soil characteristics, and that root ectomycorrhizal colonization is influenced by biotic factors such as soil microbiota. From a practical point of view, data from the present study demonstrate that it is possible to optimize the effect of fungi on plant growth by screening soils under nursery conditions.@@@Australian Acacia

Some research results suggest that artificial plantations can promote natural regeneration. The efforts in establishing protective forests in Hong Kong over the last 50 years after the Second World War have resulted in many exotic tree plantations which are ideal sites for the study of natural regeneration. This study looked at the seed rain and understorey woody plant diversity in three Lophostemon confertus plantations (25–40 years old) in Hong Kong. All the plantations were > 1 km from the nearest seed sources. Two of the plantations had a seed rain comparable in density and diversity to unplanted grasslands, and the understorey plant diversity was also low and dominated by shrubs. The other site had a higher and more diverse seed rain, as well as higher understorey stem density, but both the seed rain and the understorey were dominated by the shrub Psychotria asiatica. The poor seed rain at two sites and the rarity of potential canopy tree species in both the seed rain and understory regeneration at all sites suggest that planting exotic monocultures does not promote succession. Enrichment planting will be needed to restore forest diversity.@@@Seed rain

We examined above-ground biomass and macronutrients, leaf area and crown structure in 5-year old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziessi (Mirb.) Franco) growing with VC and with no vegetation control (NVC) in coastal Washington, United States of America. Trees in VC had larger stem, branch, foliage and total biomass than trees of equal stem diameter at 1.3 m above ground in NVC. The difference in component biomass between treatments was in the order: branch > foliage > stem. Trees in the VC regime did not differ in macronutrient concentration in stem, branch and foliage except for branch N which was greater in NVC than in VC. Differences in tree macronutrient stores between VC and NVC ranged from 2.2 times for Mg to 2.6 times for N and K. The relationship between stem diameter and leaf area was linear in both VC treatments. The relationship between stem diameter and foliage biomass was curvilinear for both VC treatments. Results of this study support the need for separated allometric equations to estimate biomass for young Douglas-fir growing in areas with and without VC.@@@Vegetation control

Tree-rings of seeded pines were calibrated against the instrumental records of local weather and large-scale atmospheric patterns and further compared to pines of natural origin on the timberline. The studied stands were shown to contain common growth variability that differed from the variability of natural pines. Deviating growth of seeded pines was attributed to their only moderate growth dependence on mid-summer (July) temperatures and, likewise, their strong dependence on the autumn climate in the previous year, and linked to the different genetic origin of artificial stands due to southern seeds. Stands were thinned for different densities in 1985 and 1986. The growth response to thinning was markedly better than could be expected according to previous studies. We found that the positive growth reaction conceivably benefited from the ameliorated winter conditions, expressed as warmed (March) temperatures and the prolonged positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (February). The results emphasize the determining influence of climatic fluctuations on reforestation and afforestation near the distributional limits of tree species.@@@Afforestation

In the field experiment, seedling roots were soaked in brassinolide solutions containing 0–0.4 mg/l pure brassinolide before planting. Survival and growth of the seedlings were determined 8 months later. The results showed that soaking roots in brassinolide prior to planting significantly increased the survival and growth of seedlings. The best results were in the 0.2 mg/l brassinolide treatment. In the pot experiment, roots were soaked in 0–0.4 mg/l brassinolide before planting followed by a foliar application of brassinolide when the seedlings leafed out. After the seedlings were established, the soil water content in the pots was regulated to simulate drought conditions and various physiological parameters were measured. The results showed that treatment with 0.2 mg/l brassinolide decreased the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of seedlings growing under moderate or severe water stress compared to untreated seedlings. Leaf water content, predawn water potential, soluble sugar content, free proline content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities were all greater in water-stressed seedlings in the 0.2 mg/l brassinolide treatment compared to the control. The results indicate that the application of brassinolide can ameliorate the effects of water stress and enhance drought resistance of Robinia seedlings. Treatment of seedlings with brassinolide may be a useful management tool for afforestation projects in arid and semiarid areas.@@@Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings

In conifer trials, the growth of white spruce, black spruce, lodgepole pine, and larch seedlings observed on different sites varied greatly to different inoculation treatments depending on plant and fungal species involved. Five years after outplanting, most of the introduced fungi were replaced by several indigenous ectomycorrhizal fungal species except for Laccaria bicolor strain. Survival rates of most of the inoculated seedlings were not significantly different from control seedlings naturally colonized by other resident fungi. In hardwood trial, the effects of nursery inoculation of different poplar clones, aspen and balsam poplar were very limited. Growth and survival data were combined into seedling volume and plot volume index (PVI) for measurement of total growth response of seedlings. Our results demonstrated that certain inoculated plant-fungus combinations have played a positive role during the initial establishment of these seedlings in the field, which was reflected on significantly greater stem volume and PVI compared to non-inoculated control seedlings. The results from this study provided useful information on field evaluation for potential benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation in nursery.@@@Inoculation

Fertilization was done in May 2003 to see whether growth rates could be increased and rotations shortened. Three fertilizers (N, NP and NPKS + Cu + Zn) were applied at each of three rates (supplying N at 0, 100 and 200 kg ha−1) in a factorial randomized block design to the two separate plantations. Fertilization with 200 kg ha−1 N and 100 kg ha−1 P increased volume growth of clone 27 by 1 m3 ha−1 year−1 over 2 years. Clone 794 showed no volume response to fertilization, but produced 8.7 m3 ha−1 more than clone 27. Leaf area, dry mass and nutrient concentrations of both clones increased in the first year after fertilization, showing that fertilizer uptake occurred. Decrease in leaf size between 2003 and 2004 was affected by fertilizer level in clone 794. There were differences between some nutrient concentrations in the soils occupied by the two clones, and clone 794 had higher leaf concentrations of N, K, Ca, S, Mn, Zn, B and Mo than clone 27. Fertilization of 4-year old plantations of either clone was unwarranted, and planting clone 794 would be likely to provide greater yield than planting and fertilizing clone 27.@@@Populus

Karst. seedlings were investigated under nursery conditions. Before NLOAD, second-year container seedlings were either short-day (SD) treated for 3 weeks in July or left for the natural photoperiod (CO). By mid-September, after 5 weeks of NLOAD, the fertilization of three foliar nutrient concentration levels (low = L-SD, medium = M-SD, and high = H-SD) for the SD-treated seedlings and one (medium = M-CO) for the CO-seedlings was completed. The NLOAD resulted in foliar nitrogen concentration 10.6, 16.1, 22.3, and 17.5 g kg−1 for L-SD, M-SD, H-SD and M-CO seedlings, respectively. The NLOAD had no effects on the morphology or dry mass variables of the seedlings, while SD-treatment reduced the dry mass of shoots, but not that of roots. The frost hardiness (FH) of different batches of the seedlings was assessed by the visual scoring of damage in their needles, stems and buds after their controlled exposure to freezing during frost hardening and dehardening. The low nutrient concentration in the SD-treated seedlings (L-SD seedlings) resulted in poor FH, to an even lower extent than that of the M-CO seedlings. The NLOAD did not affect the dehardening of the seedlings at the end of the freezer storage in the following spring.@@@Frost hardiness

This study investigates whether one general allometric equation can predict biomass of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) seedlings grown under three levels of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). It also identifies which commonly used variables (A, D 2H or D 2) were the best for predicting seedling biomass under these conditions. Radiata pine seedlings were grown with constant daytime (12 h d−1) PPFD = 500, 250 or 125 μmol m−2 s−1 for 11 weeks. Seedlings were randomly selected every 10 d for measurement. Analysis of covariance tested whether the relationship between seedling biomass and A, D 2H or D 2 varied for each PPFD level. PPFD levels influenced the relationship between biomass and A, D 2H or D 2. As a result, “full” allometric models which varied with PPFD levels were more accurate and precise at predicting biomass than “reduced” models which did not vary with PPFD level, although a “reduced” model using D 2 also performed well.@@@Diameter

Laws.) is the most planted conifer species in the forest-steppe ecotone of Patagonia, Argentina, because of its adaptability and excellent growth rates. In spite of this, and the increasing demand for this species, local commercial seed lots showed low quality, making hazardous seedling production. Aiming to upgrade germinability of a local seed lot, we set an experiment to determine the duration of the prechilling period (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 days) that promoted the highest seed germination speed (GE) and percentage (GP). Moreover, part of that lot was IDS treated, in an attempt to separate empty and dead filled seeds from viable seeds. Results showed that after 40 days prechilling, GE reached 62%, and GP 70%, both higher than the values obtained under customary conditions. The application of the IDS technique, after 40 days prechilling, 8 h drying at ambient conditions (16 ± 2°C and 50% HR), and 25% seed moisture content (mc), increased GE and GP to 68% and 89%, respectively. Optimal prechilling periods and the application of the IDS technique successfully improved germinability of ponderosa pine seeds from Patagonian stands.@@@Pinus ponderosa

However, many peat-swamp forest tree species have resulted in the reduction due to over-exploitation, forest fires and conversion into agricultural land in Indonesia. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, Glomus clarum and G. aggregatum, on the early growth of two slow-growing peat-swamp forest tree species, Ploiarium alternifolium and Calophyllum hosei, under greenhouse conditions. Cuttings of P. alternifolium and C. hosei were uninoculated or inoculated with G. clarum and G. aggregatum and grown under greenhouse conditions for 6 months. Percentage AM colonization, plant growth, phosphorus (P) concentration and survival rate were measured. The AM colonization of P. alternifolium and C. hosei ranged from 27 to 32% and 18 to 19%, respectively. Colonization by G. clarum and G. aggregatum increased shoot height, stem diameter, leaf number, and shoot and root dry weights. Cutting shoot P content were increased by AM fungal colonization. The survival rates of inoculated plants were higher (100%) than those of control plants (67%). The results suggest that inoculation with AM fungi improves early growth of P. alternifolium and C. hosei in a tropical peat-swamp forest and can therefore contribute to rehabilitation of peat-swamps.@@@Glomus

Treatments consisted in a combination of practices applied in the row and in the inter-row. In the row (1-m wide) vegetation was manually cut with machete (r-M), treated with glyphosate at 3% (r-H) or maintained undisturbed (r-U); in the inter-row vegetation was crushed with a roller (I-R), treated with glyphosate at 3% (I-H) or maintained undisturbed (I-U). Height, diameter and relative growth rate of the dominant sprout were evaluated. Tree survival was high (96%) and not affected by treatments. Growth was modified by the vegetation control at early stages. Height and diameter were higher in r-H plots compared to r-U plots; both were similar in the I-U and I-H plots but greater than in I-R plots. Early differences in diameter relative growth rate among row treatments were found. Possible mechanisms associated with willow growth responses such as plastic responses under resource limited conditions and amelioration of the microenvironment by the native vegetation are discussed.@@@Willow

Baker is a potential agroforestry species endemic to Ethiopia. No documented information exists about genetic variation in this species, thus baseline information is needed to initiate improvement program. Here, we quantified variations in seed size, germination and seedling growth at nursery stage based on seeds collected from six sites across the natural range of distribution of the species in Ethiopia. All seed- and seedling-related traits exhibited highly significant differences among seed sources (P < 0.01), and the magnitude of genetic variation was substantially higher (77–99%) than the environmental variation. The genetic advance as percent of the mean was higher for germination capacity (69.4%) and seed weight (31.7%) than for other traits, suggesting that the population means for these traits may be changed considerably by selecting the superior 5% of the genotypes. There were strong phenotypic (rp = 0.81) and genotypic (rg = 0.89) correlations between seed width and seed weight, so also between seedling height and root collar diameter (rp = 0.95 and rg = 1.00). In conclusion, the results reveal the existence of substantial genetic variation, which can be utilized to initiate tree improvement program of the species and for gene conservation in seed banks.@@@Ethiopia

Two-month-old seedlings were grown under water supply regimes of 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20% water field capacity (FC), respectively, in a temperature and light-controlled greenhouse. Plant height and leaf number were measured monthly over a 4-month period, while water use (WU), water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf relative water content (RWC), biomass production and its partitioning were recorded at the end of the experiment. Seedlings exhibited the greatest biomass production, height, basal diameter, branch number, leaf number, and leaf area when soil content was at 100% FC, and slightly declined at 80% FC. These parameters declined significantly under 60% FC water supply, and severely reduced under 40 and 20% FC. RWC, WU and WUE decreased, while the ratio of root mass to stem mass (R:S) increased in response to decreasing water supply. Water stress caused leaf shedding, but not plant death. The results demonstrated that B. faberi var. microphylla seedlings could tolerate drought by reducing branching and leaf area while maintaining a high R:S ratio. However, low dry mass and WUE at 40 and 20% FC suggested that the seedlings did not produce significant biomass under prolonged severe water deficit. Therefore, before introducing B. faberi var. microphylla in vegetation restoration efforts, water supply above 40% FC is recommended for seedlings to maintain growth.@@@Drought stress

A trial of 11 Peruvian provenances was established in three planting zones. Tree growth at 6, 12, 18 and 30 months and wood density at 32 months were analyzed across and within zones. Zones accounted for more variation than provenances. Density varied significantly due to provenances in the analysis across zones, whereas growth exhibited strong provenance by zone interactions. The local provenance grew well and produced relatively dense wood in all zones. The relative magnitude of variation due to provenances depended on the planting zone. Density was greater in the lower than in the upper stem. Density increased with longitude from the more humid to the drier part of the sample region. In general, correlations indicated that larger trees had lower density and a larger difference in density between the lower and upper stem, but the strength of these relationships depended on the provenance and zone. Results suggest that fast-growing provenances can be selected at an early age without significantly reducing wood density. The local provenance is recommended for reforestation pending future research demonstrating the superiority of foreign provenances. Some practical implications for tree-improvement programs are discussed.@@@Provenance

These clones were obtained from India and Nepal. Single-node leafy cuttings were prepared from the vegetative multiplication garden to examine the clonal variation, effect of IBA treatment on rooting response and associated metabolic changes during adventitious root formation. A remarkable and significant variation was observed due to treatment of 2,000 ppm IBA in the rooting parameters. Clonal variations were also significant for root and shoot growth while length of root was insignificant. Among the twelve clones studied; C3 (Tulsipur, Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India) and C4 (Laxmipur, Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India) clone cuttings have given the highest rooting response. Interaction (clone × IBA) was significant only for production of number of roots per cutting. Periodic sampling for clone C3 was performed at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days to examine the contents of total soluble sugars, starch, protein and peroxidase (PER) activity in the rooting zone of cuttings (∼0.5 cm) during adventitious root primordium development. A significant increase in all the metabolic activities was noted due to IBA. Total soluble sugars and starch contents of cuttings decreased with the passage of time. Protein content and PER-activity started to increase in the early stage and reached the highest level on day 21, followed by a decline at the 35th day of sampling. These trends were common for both IBA treated and untreated cuttings. Protein content and PER-activity remained higher in the rooting zone of IBA treated cuttings. Overall these findings suggested that exogenous application of IBA may have activated carbohydrate metabolism for release of energy, while protein and PER-activity were necessary for cell division and differentiation during adventitious root primordium initiation and development in the rooting zone of cuttings.@@@Clone

There have been four different government forest policies in Bangladesh since 1894. The first two forest policies (1894 and 1955) were exploitative in nature. Most of the regulatory documents were developed during the first two policy periods. The third forest policy instituted in 1979 by the sovereign Bangladesh government had contradictory elements and mutually inconsistent policy statements. It addressed for the first time forestry extension through mass motivation campaign. Current forest policy formulated in 1994 has been considered to be the most elaborate policy in the history of the country. Under this policy, participatory social forestry has been institutionalized in Bangladesh. The analysis shows that, although it is possible to attain the stated policy targets, progress is slow and is blocked on several fronts. A number of identified technical, managerial and logistical problems are hindering policy and program implementation. In addition, corruption contributes to the observed problems. The real strength of Bangladesh forestry is locally based, participatory forestry, co-management of protected areas and highly motivated people who increasingly recognize the need for a healthy forest ecosystem that will provide future economic stability. Because it is the rich homestead forests of Bangladesh that generate the majority of commercial forestry products, it is important that education continues at the grass-roots level. In addition, educated forestry and environment professionals have been identified as the future driving forces towards better, and sustainable, forest management. Results of this study make it clear that Bangladesh and other developing countries are not presently in a position to accept and adopt internationally derived forest policies due to inadequate institutional support, political instability and poor governance. Therefore, along with development of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management and forest certification, international policy scientists must consider institutional development, professional skill development, identification and adoption of indigenous technology and long-term financial support in developing countries. Without these, all international processes, policies and directives will be of little value and produce few substantive results.@@@Policy

Broad sense heritability (clonal repeatability), and correlations among characters were estimated. Around one quarter of the seed production occurred in the top portion, half in the middle and one quarter in the bottom portion of the crown for all orchards. The percentage of filled seeds varied little with the crown position, indicating more or less similar levels of selfing in the bottom of the crown as in the top. The seed weight was typically 11 mg. Differences were found for studied cone and seed characters among orchards and crown positions. Variation among grafts within clone was higher than among clones for most characters. The heritability was on average below 0.5 (e.g., cone diameter, number of filled seed per cone) and rarely rose above that (e.g., cone form, length/diameter; percentage of filled seed) for any individual characters. The coefficient of variation within clones was often higher than among clones. Thus, non-genetic factors seem often more important for the variation in performance of grafts than their genetic constitution. Cone form (length/diameter) was the character where the clone influence was the strongest. Cone number and cone dry weight showed significant correlations with seed characters (numbers of total and filled seed, percentage and weight of filled seeds). Significant correlation was found between seed characters.@@@Scots pine

B.S.P.) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) seed was investigated. Germination of white spruce control (untreated) seeds and seeds adjusted to 2–3% and 5–6% WC declined after 48 months of storage at −80 and −196°C, with a further decline at 60 months at −20, −80, −196°C. Germination remained high when control white spruce seeds and seeds with 2–3, 5–6% WC were stored at +4°C, over all storage durations. Generally, black spruce and lodgepole pine exhibited high germination at all storage temperatures at 2–3% and 5–6% WC as well as the control (untreated) seed, for up to 60 months in storage. Germination declined for all three species when seed was conditioned to 22–25% WC. This loss in germination was partially recovered in white spruce seed stored at +4, −20 and −80°C after storage durations of 24, 12 and 48 months, respectively, and in black spruce seeds stored at −20 and −196°C after storage durations of 24 months. Mean germination time (MGT) was relatively constant for all species, under all conditions, except for seed conditioned to 22–25% WC, where MGT increased for white spruce seed stored 48 months at −80 and −196°C, and for black spruce seed stored 24 months at +4 and −80°C and 60 months at −196°C. These results show that the optimal storage temperatures are 4°C for white spruce, and 4, −20, −80, and −196°C for black spruce and lodgepole pine, and 2–6% water content is optimal for all 3 species at these temperatures.@@@Black spruce

"392","Physiological and field growth responses of oak seedlings to warm storage@@@@@@Received: 04 July 2007 Accepted: 06 April 2008 Published: 22 April 2008 Issue Date: September 2008@@@The effect of warm storage (15°C) for 0, 15 or 31 days, applied after cold storage until April, and date of lifting to cold storage on the physiological condition and field performance of two-year-old oak seedlings (Quercus robur L.) was investigated. Assessments before planting included plant moisture status, root and shoot dry weight, root growth potential (RGP), while after planting root growth, shoot growth phenology, shoot and root dry matter accumulation and stem quality were assessed. Warm storage effects were large, but lift date effects were small. Warm storage for 31 days reduced height and diameter growth, stem quality, total biomass, root growth, and reduced stem quality in the field, but 15 days storage had a smaller effect. Warm storage delayed bud break and shoot growth cessation but survival was unaffected. The depletion of food reserves during storage and low moisture availability might have caused shoot dieback leading to the development of poor quality stems. There was evidence that dry weight fraction of both the shoot tip and the taproot provided good information on the quality of the stock before planting. RGP was also a good indicator of quality. Electrolyte leakage readings from fine and taproots were not reliable indicators of plant quality.@@@Plant quality

We present results from two plots that represent extreme conditions: (a) a seasonally waterlogged, non-saline site (Nahalal), and (b) a saline site (Ginnegar) located in the Yizre’el Valley, Israel. Six improved seed sources, four of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and two of E. occidentalis, were examined. The local Israeli seed source of E. camaldulensis (HA) performed best at both sites. In Nahalal, the short rotation thinning of the slower growing (50%) plantation trees could provide economic returns approximately five years after establishment. The calculated mean annual increment (MAI) of these trees reached 12.2 t ha−1 year−1. The long rotation, or better performing half of the plantation trees, could be used as a source of sawn timber, providing higher-value products. By nine years after establishment, the average DBH of the various seed sources reached 25.8 ± 1.9 cm. The calculated MAI of the combined cutting rotations reached 48.3 t ha−1 year−1. Eucalyptus grown under the combined (short- and long-term) management approach at Nahalal was more profitable than many other non-irrigated local crops. Eucalyptus production in Ginnegar would be less profitable than in Nahalal. However, an additional ecological benefit was provided by the crop’s ability to lower the water table. When this contribution to regional drainage is taken into account, trees become economically competitive with other non-irrigated field crops under saline conditions.@@@Eucalyptus camaldulensis

Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden and E. pilularis Smith seedlings were examined. All transplanting treatments increased severity and incidence of J-rooting for both species. Gently loosening seedling plugs by hand prior to their removal from cells of 512 trays and gentle manual production of seedling planting holes (dibbering) in potting media in Hiko cells, rather than mechanically loosening and mechanical dibbering, reduced the incidence of J-rooting for both species. Disturbance of seedling plugs from mechanized loosening and increased compaction from mechanical dibbering are believed to have a negative effect on root development. Direct sowing produced seedlings with highest root quality when measured at 27 weeks.@@@Eucalyptus pilularis

Chev@@@@@@Received: 23 July 2006 Accepted: 26 March 2008 Published: 08 April 2008 Issue Date: September 2008@@@Leaf area, IBA concentration and age of stockplants were all found to be important factors for successful rooting for vegetative propagation using single-node cuttings of the two main African mahogany species: Khaya anthotheca and K. ivorensis. Cuttings with leaf area of 30–50 cm2 had the best rooting percentage and cuttings with about 30 cm2 had the most number of roots per cutting in K. anthotheca. Khaya ivorensis, cuttings with 10–30 cm2 leaf area had the highest rooting percentage. Cuttings collected from 1-year-old stockplants recorded the highest rooting percentage and largest number of roots per cutting. Cuttings from 3-year-old stockplant of the same seeds sources had the lowest rooting suggesting aging negatively impacted rooting ability. The effect of auxin concentration, on rootability was examined with cuttings of K. anthotheca. An IBA concentration of 0.8% was the best exogenous auxin concentration for percentage rooting, number of roots per cutting and the length of the longest root per cutting.@@@Khaya species

Survival after 2 years was good across all treatment (>90%) except for the large bare-root seedlings growing in the control site (84%). For all the morphological characteristics assessed in this study, there was no significant interaction between stocktype and cultivation treatment indicating that the growth response to site cultivation was not stocktype dependent. After two growing seasons, all Norway spruce seedlings performed better in the deep ploughed site and displayed also better nutritional and physiological status. Regardless of cultivation treatment, mean height, diameter and volume increment were significantly smaller for the large bare-root seedlings while the small bare-root seedlings displayed the greatest growth rates. In order to promote early height growth in container and small bare-root stock, large diameter is important. Other initial characteristics such as foliar nitrogen content may also have a strong influence on first year field performance. The physiological status of the seedlings during the first year after outplanting was assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) measurements. CF measurements detected a higher level of stress for the large-bare root stock (low Fv/Fm). On the other hand, small bare-root stock displayed highest maximum potential photochemical activity which corresponded to greatest growth rates. Container seedlings demonstrated higher capacity for photosynthetic electron transport during the first five months after planting suggesting that they recovered from planting stress quicker and optimised better light interception and utilization than bare-root stock. It can be concluded that intensive management systems including deployment of best-adapted stocktype and site cultivation can be used to enhance early height growth of Norway spruce on cutaway peatlands.@@@Norway spruce

Volcanic eruptions create harsh conditions that can preclude native plant establishment. We tested the performance of two native species Pinus pseudostrobus and P. montezumae for restoration of volcanic ash covered areas. Two age classes of P. pseudostrobus and one of P. montezumae were tested as well as the effect of mulching to ameliorate harsh substrate conditions. Results show that older plants of P. pseudostrobus (19-month old at planting) have higher survival and growth rates than young plants (8-months at planting). Plants at least 19-months-old at planting of P. pseudostrobus and P. montezumae, are appropriate for restoration of volcanic ash covered areas.

Irving Limited (JDISSO) were compared in a block-plot genetic gain test on four sites in New Brunswick, Canada. Three seedlots representing different genetic quality of the orchard were included: before rogueing (UNR), following the first rogueing (1STR), and following the second rogueing (2NDR). Two stand seedlots were included to represent an average unimproved commercial seedlot (UC) for comparison. Individual tree growth and stem straightness were recorded up to age 15 (one-third rotation age). For individual tree growth, there was no strong evidence of better performance of the UNR over the UC, but the 1STR and 2NDR grew much faster. For volume per hectare, all the JDISSO seedlots outperformed the UC. The realized gains per hectare were higher than those on individual tree basis, but both increased with rogueing time and decreased with age. Improvement in stem straightness was also significant for all the orchard seedlots. The realized genetic gains were generally comparable to the respective predicted ones from the family tests. Analyses of individual sites indicated that the realized gain varied greatly with site, especially for growth traits. Deploying good seedlots to better sites would result in more volume gains. Overall, results of this study indicate the efficiency of the seed orchard procedure for jack pine.@@@Tree improvement

This work analyzed biochemical and morphological changes during adventitious rooting of mini-cuttings of E. globulus × maidenni obtained from mini-stumps cultured in drip fertigated sand bed or intermittent flooding tray commercial propagation systems. Morphological (% rooting, root number and length, mean rooting time) and biochemical parameters (peroxidase activity, total phenolic content and flavonoid content) were monitored to characterize the rooting phases. All of the rooting parameters were equivalent in both systems, indicating comparable efficiency of both methods in clonal propagation. Kinetic profiles of biochemical parameters were also similar, although the activity of peroxidases was an order of magnitude higher and the phenolic content about three times lower in cuttings derived from intermittent flooding-grown mini-stumps than in those derived from sand bed-grown mini-stumps. Taken together, results suggest that rooting phases were similar in both systems: induction before day 5, formation from day 5 to 15, and elongation from day 15 to 45. These data may contribute to the development of rooting phase-specific mineral nutrient solutions to maximize clonal propagation and plant survival.@@@Peroxidase activity

A total of 42 and 41 provenances, each represented by two to five open-pollinated families were evaluated at each site, respectively. Results indicate that red alder provenances responded differently to the environmental conditions of the two sites. At age 10, red alder provenances tended to perform better at sites near their origin. The results support earlier work that two breeding zones should be delineated with the boundary at approximately 52° N. One may expect an average of about 5% decrease in stem volume and 6% increase in mortality, respectively, for each degree of southward and northward transfer of seed sources from their origins. Individual, family, and within-family heritabilities for height, diameter, stem volume were moderately high (0.22–0.42), for the southern zone, implying good potential for genetic improvement. Heritabilities were somewhat lower (0.12–0.39) for the northern zone because of greater environmental heterogeneity of the test site. Selecting the top 20 unrelated individuals for seed orchard establishment would result in 29% and 23% gain in stem volume at a rotation age of 40 years in the southern and northern zones, respectively. Correlation between ranks of the predicted breeding values for height at different ages and stem volume at age 10 increased rapidly when plantation was young and became relatively stable after 6 years of out-planting. Stem volume had much stronger correlation with diameter (≥0.84) than with height (≤0.67). Early selection at age 6 based on stem volume is therefore recommended.@@@Open-pollinated provenance-progeny tests

To identify the causes of the regeneration failure, the authors tested the effects of site preparation in a thinned stand and in a clearcut on the emergence and early establishment of L. olgensis seedlings. The results indicated that there was no correlation between cumulative emergence percentage (CEP) of L. olgensis seedlings and canopy openness, but the CEP was significantly affected by site preparation (P < 0.001). The average seedling survival rates after treatments consisting of removing both litter cover and understory vegetation cover were significantly higher in the clearcut than in the thinned stand (P < 0.001). Without site preparation, all seedlings in both the thinned stand and the clearcut disappeared within the first growing season, meaning that ground cover (understory vegetation cover and litter cover) was not beneficial to seedling survival. The average growth of seedlings exhibited significant differences between the thinned stand and the clearcut, and among the site preparations (P < 0.001). Intensely thinned stands without ground cover improved seedling growth. These results imply that light and ground cover might be the main factors limiting the early establishment of L. olgensis seedlings in managed plantation forests@@@Cumulative emergence percentage (CEP)

The sprouting capabilities of the stumps varied among tree species. The stumps of 60 species could produce sprouts, while those of the other two species could not. In 10 of the sprouting species, the mean sprout-stem number was higher than 4.0 stems per stump; nine sprouting species showed low sprouting capabilities. Additionally, Castanopsis sieboldii and Schima wallichii, the dominant species, exhibited high sprouting capabilities. Further, the sprouting capabilities varied with stump diameter at breast height (DBH). Stumps with a larger DBH tended to have a higher mean number of sprout stems per stump, higher DBH, and higher tree height than the smaller stumps. The forest stands regenerated by sprouting might recover into a tree community similar to that before clear-cutting.@@@Sprouting capability

The trial followed a design described by Barnes (Silv Genet 44(2–3):81–88, 1995) as the Breeding Seedling Orchard (BSO). The objectives of the study were to determine variation in growth and form traits and estimate genetic parameters of families. Assessments conducted at 3–8 years for height, diameter at breast height (dbh), straightness and forking showed significant differences (P < 0.05) among families with Guys (19), Settrington (34), Overbury (23) and Grimthorpe (36) being the best performers while Coleford (3 and 5) Gwynedd (27) and Bacheiddon (32) were the least performers. At the overall level, the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) ranged between 10.2 and 12.7% for height and 1.5 and 2.1% for dbh. Height had a high genetic correlation (rg = 0.85) with dbh whilst forking had low correlation (rg = 0.25) with height. Estimates of heritability decreased with age from \( {\text{h}}^{2}_{{\text{i}}}\) = 0.62 at 3 years to \( {\text{h}}^{2}_{{\text{i}}}\) = 0.30 at 8 years for height while values for dbh decreased from \( {\text{h}}^{2}_{{\text{i}}}\) = 0.48 at 4 years to \( {\text{h}}^{2}_{{\text{i}}}\) = 0.27 at 8 years. Some genetic gains are possible despite the low genetic variation among families; height had the greatest potential of genetic gain (12.5% at 8 years). Results suggest that early selection of superior families of Fraxinus excelsior appears to be feasible and it could be possible to achieve simultaneous improvement in both growth and form.@@@CVA

Effect of four treatments: (a) sex of donor plant (male and female), (b) age/type of shoot (1, 2, 3 year old, long and dwarf shoots), (c) auxin treatment (IBA and NAA at 0, 0.5, 1.25, 5.0 & 50.0 mM) and (d) rooting environment (raised beds/polythene bags) on percentage rooting in stem cuttings was studied. Randomized complete block (RBD) designs were used for experimentation. Rooting ability of cuttings was significantly influenced by all these treatments. The overall rooting response was higher in long shoot cuttings taken from female tree. Age of shoot also influenced the rooting response and was highest in 1 year old long shoot cuttings of female tree. Exogenous application of auxin, α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and indole-3 butyric acid (IBA), had significant positive effect on the percentage rooting. IBA significantly enhanced the rooting percentage in 1 year old long and dwarf shoots at lower doses and 2 and 3 year old long shoots from female tree at higher doses. Maximum percent rooting (90% ± 2.8) was obtained with interactive effect of 0.5 mM, NAA (22 h) × 1 year old long shoot from female tree; followed by the interactive effect of 50 mM IBA (5 s) × 3 year old long shoot from female tree (83% ± 4.1). Cuttings planted in soil: sand medium in polythene bags showed earlier rooting response (12 weeks) than cuttings planted in raised nursery beds (24 weeks). Overall, the findings of this study suggest that 0.5 mM IBA treatment is suitable for enhancing adventitious rooting in 1 year old long and dwarf shoots of male and female trees. IBA at higher doses is suitable for enhancing the rooting percentage of 2 and 3 year old long shoots from female tree. This study provides a significant lead towards the development of a simple and inexpensive technique for large scale propagation, aforestation of elite genotypes and raising of bush type plantation under ex-situ conditions.@@@Himalayan yew

At Pudukkottai, a semi-arid site in Tamil Nadu State, five treatments were applied: (1) untreated control, (2) nitrogen (two doses of urea at 217 g N/tree), (3) nitrogen plus phosphorus (two doses of 312 g single superphosphate), potassium (two doses of 83 g muriate of potash) and trace elements (two doses of 10 g sodium borate and 25 g zinc sulphate), (4) pollarding trees at 4 m height with application of N, P, K and trace elements, (5) drenching with the flowering promoter Paclobutrazol (0.25 ml active ingredient per cm of stem girth) along with N, P, K and trace elements. At Panampalli, a higher-rainfall site in Kerala State, only treatments 1, 2 and 3 were applied. Four replicates of treatment plots sized 18 m × 18 m, with 22–32 trees per plot were set up in each orchard in randomized complete block designs. Untreated plots of E. camaldulensis and E. tereticornis at Pudukkottai displayed 12 and 21% fertile trees, respectively, in the first year of monitoring, while at Panampally the percentage of fertile trees in untreated E. camaldulensis plots was higher at 72%, and that of E. tereticornis similar at 23%. Both species attained greater stem diameter at breast height at age 9 years at the higher-rainfall location but there was no significant impact of fertilizer application on 9-year diameter at either site. Diameter was reduced by pollarding and Paclobutrazol application at Pudukkottai. Only Paclobutrazol produced a significant increase in fertility in both species for four successive years, increasing the percentage of fertile trees to 59 and 71%, respectively, for E. camaldulensis and E. tereticornis 1 year after application. The number of capsules produced per tree also increased significantly with Paclobutrazol application, although the difference was comparatively less by the fourth year.

MS medium supplemented with BA (12.5 μM) was the most effective in inducing bud break and growth and also in initiating multiple shoot proliferation. However, the optimal level of TDZ supplementation to the culture medium was 5.0 μM. Shoot cultures were established by repeatedly subculturing the original nodal explants on the same medium. Highest number of shoots (11.5 ± 0.7) and shoot length (5.0 ± 0.2 cm) were achieved when cultures were subcultured on MS medium supplemented with 12.5 μM BA and 1.0 μM α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The shoots regenerated from TDZ supplemented medium when subcultured to hormone free MS basal medium considerably increased the rate of shoot multiplication and shoot length by the end of fifth subculture. Rooting of the shoots was achieved on MS medium augmented with 1.0 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) plus 0.5% activated charcoal followed by their transfer to half strength MS basal medium. The in vitro raised plantlets with well developed shoots and roots were successfully established in earthen pots containing garden soil and were grown in greenhouse with 70% survival rate.

Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and western red-cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) container seedlings under varying sulfometuron methyl (Oust XP®) herbicide application treatments. Treatments consisted of application of 0.16 kg active ingredient (ai) ha−1 as a site preparation in fall 2003, a release application in fall 2004, or a control treatment with no application. Seedlings were planted in winter 2004 and measurements recorded in summer 2004, winter 2005, and summer 2005. During first season growth, western red-cedar seedlings showed the greatest negative impact to site preparation compared to the control with overall average new root length outside the root plug reduced by 67%. Significant reductions in root length also occurred for western hemlock (47%) and Douglas-fir (40%) seedlings. About 9 months after the release treatment, and 21 months after the site preparation application, there were no significant differences between treatments for any measured parameter. These findings suggest that seedlings under the site preparation treatment recovered from initial damage incurred to the root system. Lack of seedling response under the release treatment may be the result of opposing influences from the herbicide application associated with seedling phytotoxicity and enhanced seedling development resulting from effective vegetation control. Although our study was limited to 21 months following planting, reduced vegetation cover in the site preparation and release treatments suggests that these treatments may benefit future seedling growth.@@@Douglas-fir

L. sibirica var. sukaczewii) plantations in Hallormsstaður, Iceland. The field inventory was carried out in eastern Iceland in June 2006. Models were constructed for predicting dominant height, total tree height and 5-year diameter increment. Several linear and non-linear forms of models were tested in preliminary analyses to find the equations that fitted the modelled characteristics best. Due to the spatially hierarchical correlation structure of the data (stands, plots and trees), the assumption of non-correlated error terms did not hold. Therefore, a random parameter modelling approach was adopted using mixed models when the estimates obtained for the random effects were statistically significant. The variance estimates for the random effects can be further used to calibrate the models. The models generated here performed well with independent test data and were consistent with the forest growth theory. They can be used to evaluate site quality and to estimate the growth and yield of larch stands in eastern Iceland in connection with forest planning.@@@Diameter increment

Stem cuttings of EAG as well as cuttings of other species treated with EAG latex reportedly root easily in dry soil. This could be attributable to endogenous auxins contained in the latex. We screened EAG latex for auxins and precursor molecules using analytical LC-MS/MS, and tested the effect of EAG latex on the rooting of woody cuttings of Boswellia papyrifera, a threatened multipurpose tree. The EAG latex contained indole acetic acid (IAA) (0.06 μg/g latex), an auxin controlling apical dominance and lateral rooting, as well as IAA metabolites and conjugates. Boswellia cuttings treated with EAG latex rooted significantly sooner and showed higher survival ratios than untreated controls. EAG is widely available and its latex easy to obtain. Therefore it is a promising source of a natural plant growth regulator which may be used for improving low technology vegetative propagation of woody species in East and Northeast Africa, including the threatened Boswellia tree.@@@Auxins

"412","Implication of genotype × site interaction on Pinus radiata breeding in Galicia@@@@@@Received: 31 October 2007 Accepted: 23 June 2008 Published: 09 July 2008 Issue Date: January 2009@@@The magnitude and practical importance of family × site interactions for growth and form traits considered in radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) breeding were analysed by four different methods: type B genetic correlation, regression coefficient, mean rank deviation and ecovalence. The material analysed consisted in growth, form and frost resistance assessments of 58 open pollinated half-sib families at 3 to 4 years old across three sites in Galicia (NW Spain). Analysis of variance revealed that family × site interactions were quantitatively important for all traits (diameter, volume, branch angle, straightness and frost resistance). The losses in potential genetic gain for a breeding population were important for all traits under individual selection but only for diameter and frost resistance under family selection. Omission of the ten most interactive families from the analysis considerably reduced the losses for all traits, although losses in potential genetic gain remained important for frost resistance under family selection. The results indicate that elimination of these families from breeding programmes would be an effective strategy for selecting for stability in performance across sites for all traits except frost resistance. In order to overcome this problem, selecting varieties for frost resistance specifically adapted to various regional contexts would be an option. However further studies under controlled conditions are required before making final decisions for radiata pine breeding programmes.@@@Family-site interaction

The age-age genetic correlations for height ranged from 0.68 to 0.99, and phenotypic correlations from 0.28 to 0.84. Age-age phenotypic correlations for height had a strong linear relationship with logarithm of age ratio (R 2 = 0.89) but age-age genetic correlations had a weak linear relationship with logarithm of age ratio (R 2 = 0.27). Early selection efficiency for height was examined using the ratio of gain per year between indirect early selection and direct selection at age 25. When flowering age was assumed to be 10 years, optimum selection age was predicted to be 10 using either the genetic or the phenotypic linear model. When flowering age was assumed to be 3 years, optimum selection age was predicted to be 3 and 8 years based on the genetic and phenotypic linear models, respectively. The phenotypic linear model underestimated genetic gain at all ages, particularly at young ages.@@@Age-age correlation

Effects of clonal capacities and auxin treatments on rooting of C. buxifolia and C. aquarum semi-hardwood cuttings taken from wild populations were evaluated in four experiments. Different phenotypes varied in their capacity to root (from 0 to more than 80%) and this underlines the importance of collecting cuttings from different plants when revegetation programs are based on vegetative propagation. The experiments evaluated the effectiveness of IBA at 5, 10 and 20 g kg−1, IAA at 5 and 10 g kg−1 and NAA at 1 and 2 g kg−1 treatments to enhance rooting of C. buxifolia tip cuttings and C. aquarum tip and stem cuttings compared to control cuttings with no applied auxin. With the exception of IAA, auxin treatments enhanced the percentage of cuttings with roots and significantly improved the number of roots per cutting and root length. In this study, the best treatment is 10 g kg−1 IBA for C. buxifolia. For C. aquarum, 20 g kg−1 IBA significantly enhances quantitatively and qualitatively rooting of both tip and stem cuttings.@@@Phenotypic rooting capacity

The short-term impact of competition control on the growth of juvenile trees and how tree responses to competition control differed across the productivity gradient was of particular interest, as was the determination of which resource was most highly competed for and was most important in determining tree growth. Eight sets of paired plots in juvenile hybrid poplar plantations were established in central Saskatchewan across a range of site productivities. In each pair, one plot had complete weed control (weed-free) while in the other plot weeds were allowed to grow. The best soil predictor of tree growth was soil texture, represented by a combination of the percentage silt and clay, with finer textures showing better growth. Competition control significantly increased tree growth on all sites with the benefit being greatest on the higher productivity sites. Soil water appeared to be highly competed for between trees and weeds and was a dominant resource controlling growth. For soil nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous were highly competed for between trees and weeds. However, leaf phosphorous concentration of the weed-free plots had a strong positive relation to tree growth while nitrogen did not, indicating that when trees are free of competition they can access sufficient nitrogen from these soils.@@@Agricultural soils

We conducted a browsing impact survey within 1.3 million ha of commercially managed Eucalyptus forest, and hypothesised that browsing impact would be related to variables reflecting habitat suitability for a major browsing species, the swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor Desmarest), at both large and small spatial scales. A simple spatial analysis showed that browsing severity varied across the landscape, but was high in a number of districts (30,000–100,000 ha land management units) grouped in a similar part of the surveyed area, identifying this region as a focus for management and research. Ordinal logistic regression showed that browsing impact was related to (a) the location of districts and (b) the number of times post-harvest regeneration had been attempted, with browsing impact generally worse in areas where regeneration had occurred twice. The latter result was consistent with our original hypothesis, as multiple regeneration attempts promote high quality habitat patches for wallabies. In most heavily browsed districts browsing severity varied substantially between harvested sites, suggesting that processes operating at the site scale were important. Our results describe the spatial extent of browsing within the surveyed area, and identify high risk localities and states, but additional data are required to understand the processes regulating browsing impact.@@@Herbivory

Its widespread use has entailed the over-exploitation of natural forests and a large reduction in natural diversity. Fifteen microsatellite markers were used to study the genetic variability and structure of 166 teak trees distributed over the whole natural area of teak. Analysis showed that in the teak natural area there were four main centers of genetic variability. Two clusters were in India and could be considered as main centers of genetic diversity in teak. The third cluster mainly consisting of populations in Thailand and Laos was genetically very distinct from the Indian populations but presented only half as much allelic variability. A fourth cluster from Central Laos showed even less genetic variability. The use of SSR markers for conservation of teak forest diversity is discussed.@@@Genetic structure

Fertilizer was applied to a young naturally regenerating stand in order to evaluate the effectiveness of nutrient addition as a silvicultural tool in recently clearcut stands and to better understand the ecological relationships between site fertility and stand development. The study was installed on a rising 2-year-old naturally regenerated mixed pine-hardwood stand in the Hill Demonstration Forest in the Piedmont region (Durham County) of North Carolina. Fertilizer treatments were control, N, N + P, and N + P + K (at 200 kg N per ha, 50 kg P per ha and 100 kg K per ha). On a whole stand basis, increased growth rates were observed for trees on N + P and N + P + K plots. Fertilizer treatments did not affect total stand density, but the density of loblolly pine significantly decreased in N + P plots compared to the Control. The density of stems of stump origin also increased in plots receiving N + P. Density of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) significantly increased and hickory (Carya spp.) density decreased with the application of N + P. Dominant hardwood species with the exception of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) responded with an increase in height to only N + P fertilizer treatments. Yellow-poplar increased in groundline diameter, height and mean tree volume index with the application of N + P. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) responded to N + P + K fertilizer treatment with an increase in height, diameter and volume index over the Control. There was no growth response among treatments for the 16 largest trees per species per plot, with the exception of red oak (Quercus rubra) which responded with an increase in height in N + P plots. Projected growth responses were modeled on a whole stand level and indicate that the use of N + P fertilizer may be an effective silvicultural instrument to increase growth, accelerate stand development, and shorten rotation length.@@@Mixed hardwoods

Franco) saplings in 60- to 80-year-old thinned Douglas-fir stands in southwestern Washington. We separately quantified belowground competition from overstory and understory sources using trenching and understory removal. In this light-limited environment of 26 ± 16% (std. dev.) full sunlight, 2-year exclusion of tree root competition by trenching increased sapling stem biomass by 18%, total aboveground biomass by 21%, number of interwhorl buds by 68%, total foliar biomass by 33%, and foliar biomass on branch components over 4 years old by 143%. Belowground competition did not influence shoot:root ratio or foliar efficiency (i.e., stem growth per unit foliage biomass). Sapling needle size, specific leaf area, and internodal distance also were not affected by belowground competition; these variables were apparently a function of the low-light environment. The principal source of belowground competition was roots of overstory trees; effects of belowground competition from understory vegetation were minor. Thus, under a partial overstory, morphology of Douglas-fir regeneration was influenced by both belowground and aboveground competition from overstory trees. In this environment, understory vegetation control would not likely influence belowground competition to an extent that would affect sapling morphology.@@@Douglas-fir

However, these experiments have not consistently factored in broader-scale ecological differences found in the eastern United States. Oak regeneration experiments should be replicated at appropriate ecological scales to address the similarities and differences in regeneration following prescribed silvicultural treatments among ecological units. Patterns in oak regeneration can be better understood in an ecological context by considering how oak species interact in the differing physical environments and are able to maintain dominance in changing complexes of competing vegetation among the selected eco-units. Our understanding of oak regeneration response to specific silvicultural practices and our ability to model regeneration is improved when we use replication, blocking, or factorial deployment of relatively small-scale (0.5–1.0 ha) treatment plots within an ecological classification system. We present an example of this approach to understanding oak regeneration dynamics in a synthesis of research to regenerate northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) by underplanting shelterwoods in Arkansas, Missouri and Indiana. We summarize important considerations to guide the design of future research in oak regeneration.@@@Oak regeneration

Leaf and bark of the species yield an important drug called taxol, which is used for treatment of many types of cancer. There is a serious threat to the existence of the species due to over exploitation in its native habitat. Adequate information on the nature and the extent of genetic diversity in this important species is required for developing suitable strategy for its conservation. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were used to assess genetic variation in nine natural populations of T. wallichiana from western part of the Himalayan ranges. Both the markers revealed low genetic diversity in these populations. Average heterozygosity for AFLP and RAPD were 0.3715 and 0.3072, respectively. ΦST values derived from molecular variance were 0.0855 and 0.1005 for AFLP and RAPD, respectively, whereas the corresponding GST values were 0.1796 and 0.2140. Most part of the genetic variation was present within the populations. However, between population variation was low but statistically significant, which suggested that the sampled populations might not constitute a single panmictic population. Cluster analysis and Mantel’s correlation revealed that genetic differentiation broadly followed geographic distribution of the populations. T. wallichiana thus urgently needs to be conserved using both in situ and ex situ conservation approaches.@@@Taxus wallichiana

The results indicated that each of the nine AFLP primer pairs selected generated fingerprint profiles that were unique to each of the accessions. Therefore, each accession was definitively identified by any of the nine primer pairs. Furthermore, the inter-accession genetic relationships inferred based on 461 polymorphic fragments from the nine AFLP primer pairs were largely consistent with phylogenetic relationships based on morphologic traits. Bootstrap analysis showed that three AFLP primer pairs were required to obtain genetic similarity values with a maximum CV of 10% while 10 AFLP primer pairs could give a maximum CV of 5%. Thus, AFLP can readily be applied for a rapid and accurate evaluation of the degree of similarity between poplar cultivars. In this study, the number of AFLP fragments used was sufficient to establish a reliable estimate of genetic similarity among accessions, with a maximum CV of 5.12%. Therefore, the information on the genetic relationships among the poplar accessions generated in this study in connection with knowledge on agronomic traits may have an impact on poplar breeding and planting in China.@@@AFLP

We fertilized Pinus halepensis Mill. seedlings in the nursery with controlled release fertilizer (CRF) varying in formulations and rates; 9-13-18 and 17-10-10 (N-P-K) formulations at 3, 5 and 7 g l−1 substrate plus an unfertilized control and we evaluated growth and survival 7 years after planting in arid conditions in Almería province, southeast Spain. Interactions between initial height and fertilizer treatments occurred during the first 3 years; initial size advantages of specific fertilizer treatments (7 g l−1 of 9-13-18 and 17-10-10 at 3 g l−1) persisted after 7 years. The largest and most nutrient-rich seedlings from 9-13-18 at 7 g l−1 (41.0 cm tall, 4.4 mg of P per g of root tissue at time of planting) exhibited the highest survival after 7 years (79%), while survival declined to 42% for non-fertilized plants (12.9 cm tall and 0.6 mg of P per g of root tissue). Initial seedling morphological parameters were most consistently correlated with field performance. Root P concentration was the nutrient variable most closely related to survival. Our data emphasizes importance of longer-term experiments to accurately assess influences of nursery treatments on field responses, particularly in arid areas. We suggest that larger seedlings with greater nutrient reserves than are currently being used should be incorporated into Mediterranean plantations.@@@Aleppo pine

Furthermore, diverse waste products are being used as organic amendments in certain soils before afforestation. In this study, combinations of both of these resources are considered and seven different materials were used to make mixtures of growing media used for maritime pine tree production in a forestry nursery. Pine bark, Sphagnum peat and paper mill sludge were mixed with sewage sludge, sewage activated sludge, municipal solid waste with activated composted sludge and inorganic fertilizer to fill containers where pine seeds were sown. Germination was monitored 30–50 days after sowing. Needle samples from each treatment were taken and physical parameters (height, stem diameter, aerial dry weight, main root dry weight, total dry weight) were measured along with several morphological attributes. Foliar nutrient content was also determined (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn). The highest values for germination percentage were obtained for 75% pine bark + fertilizer and for sewage sludge treatments. Seedlings grown in paper mill sludge + activated sewage sludge + peat and in paper mill sludge + activated sewage sludge + pine bark mixtures presented the best physical parameter values. Municipal solid waste and composted sludge were the most useful amendments for morphological attributes.

Seeds were collected from four natural populations in the south and southwest Yunnan province, China. Significant differences (P < 0.05) between populations were observed in seed length, seed weight and seedling morphological characters. The analyses revealed that none of the seed and seedling traits had significant correlations with the geo-climatic variables of the populations. Among seed and seedling traits, significant correlations (P < 0.05) were discovered among seed length, seed weight and height of 30-day-old seedlings. Significant correlation (r = 1.00, P < 0.01) occurred also between the height and root collar diameter of 4-year-old seedlings. With the exception of seed width and seed germination percentage, 51–96% of total variation in other seed and seedling related traits was attributed to population effect, as determined by the broad sense heritability. In conclusion, these observations on variation in seed and seedling traits should be a reference point, when considering seed collection of this species for ex situ conservation and species restoration.@@@Ex situ conservation

Rooting efficiencies of cuttings derived from two selected matured mother trees were studied using four different concentrations of Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), viz. 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4%. IBA applied at 40 μg per cutting (0.4% concentration) resulted in significantly higher rooting responses compared to the control (P < 0.05). Differences in the length of longest root for all the treatments were significant (P = 0.05) with cuttings treated with 0.2% IBA producing the longest root. The highest survival after 3 weeks of transference of the rooted cuttings into polythene bags was found for rooted cuttings treated with 0.2% IBA. Effects of three fertilizer treatments viz. T0 (no fertilizer), T1 (10 g of Urea + 20 g of TSP + 10 g of MOP dissolved in 1 l of water) and T2 (10 g of Urea + 20 g of TSP + 10 g of MOP dissolved in 2 l of water) on initial growth of established rooted cuttings (stecklings) of Stereospermum suaveolens in polythene bags were also measured for a period of 90 days. Stem length, collar diameter and leaf area of the stecklings increased throughout the observation period. Increments of both stem length and collar diameter were significantly higher for the stecklings treated with T2 in comparison with the control while increment of leaf area was found the highest for the stecklings treated with T1. The study clearly indicated that Stereospermum suaveolens is amenable to vegetative propagation technique using juvenile single-node leafy cuttings and the initial growth performance of the established rooted cuttings (stecklings) in polythene bags under different fertilizer treatments was satisfactory.@@@Bignoniaceae

The results showed that all three AM fungi infected P. ussuriensis seedlings and G. intraradices and also G. mosseae infected A. fruticosa. The AM fungi promoted growth of P. ussuriensis and Desert False indigo seedlings. Moreover, under co-cultivation with A. fruticosa, the biomass of P. ussuriensis increased significantly. The concentration of nitrogen in P. ussuriensis grown with A. fruticosa and the concentration of soluble nitrogen in the rhizosphere were also higher than when grown alone. Hypha were found on the two plant seedlings inoculated with G. mosseae and G. intraradices, suggesting that AM fungi may transport nutrients from seedlings of A. fruticosa to the rhizosphere of P. ussuriensis seedlings, which may have promoted the growth of P. ussuriensis.

Seedlings of Eucalyptus globulus subsp. maidenii were planted with 0 (W0), 25 (W25), 50 (W50) and 100% (W100) weed cover. Weed species composition and aboveground biomass was determined. Soil water content was evaluated by the gravimetric method. Seedling leaf area, diameter and height were evaluated at planting and during the 3 months following establishment. Tree height, diameter and stem volume was estimated at 12, 24 and 36 months. First year tree survival was recorded. The ratio of cumulative stem growth under W100: cumulative stem growth under W0 was used to measure competitive performance. Regression analysis was used to determine competition thresholds. Weeds seriously threaten the growth of E. globulus subsp. maidenii. Early negative effects of competition on growth were evident as from the second month after establishment, and both seedlings and 1-year-old saplings were more affected than 2- and 3-year-old ones.

An acoustic time-of-flight tool measured the velocity between two probes in the outerwood, from which the stiffness was estimated. Four stocking levels (714, 1,250, 1,667 and 3,333 sph) were examined. Stiffness varied significantly between all species, with E. cloeziana showing the highest stiffness (14.2–15.7 GPa), followed by E. pilularis (12.2–13.5 GPa) and E. dunnii (10.7–12.6 GPa). There was a stiffness increase (around 11%) between 714 and 1,250 stems/ha for all species but thereafter differences between stockings were not always significant. Trees were also assessed for basic density, dbh, total height, crown area, green crown height and stem slenderness (height/dbh). Only stem slenderness had a significant association (0.41 ± 0.17) with stiffness. These findings suggest that, where stiffness is a priority, forest managers could reduce establishment costs with low stockings (around 1,250 stems/ha).@@@Wood stiffness

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well as voluntary initiatives provide economic incentives for afforestation and reforestation efforts through the generation and sale of carbon credits. The objectives of our study were to measure the carbon (C) storage potential of 1, 2 and 10-years old Tectona grandis plantations in the province of Chiriquí, Western Panama and to calculate the monetary value of aboveground C storage if sold as Certified Emission Reduction (CER) carbon credits. The average aboveground C storage ranged from 2.9 Mg C ha−1 in the 1-year-old plantations to 40.7 Mg C ha−1 in the 10-year-old plantations. Using regression analysis we estimated the potential aboveground C storage of the teak plantation over a 20 year rotation period. The CO2-storage over this period amounted to 191.1 Mg CO2 ha−1. The discounted revenues that could be obtained by issuance of carbon credits during a 20 year rotation period were about US$460 for temporary CER and US$560 for long-term CER, and thus, contribute to a minor extent (1%) to overall revenues, only.@@@Aboveground carbon storage

Delile provenances in Niger@@@@@@Received: 08 September 2008 Accepted: 04 May 2009 Published: 17 May 2009@@@Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Delile provides wood and other essential products for farming and pastoralist communities in the West African Sahel. In this region, mean annual rainfall decreases in general from south to north and from west to east, so one might expect clinal variation in fitness-related traits in relation to the rainfall gradients. This paper presents results from a provenance/progeny test of 11 provenances sampled in Niger and established at one relatively dry site in Niger. The objectives were to evaluate phenotypic correlations (Pearson r) between tree growth (height, stem diameter) and basic density of the wood, and clines in growth and density at 13 years. Tree growth and wood density were positively correlated, and the correlations differed among provenances. Mean tree height and stem diameter of provenances increased, in general, from the more humid to the drier parts of the sample region. Results suggest that selection of faster-growing trees could lead to an increase in wood volume and density in the subsequent generation, especially in certain provenances; that provenances from drier areas are better adapted to drought; and that tree improvement and conservation programs should collect seeds from populations in the drier areas for planting and conservation.@@@Sahel

However, its nursery culture is characterized by a wide range of practices resulting in stock heterogeneity and a potentially varied outplanting performance. Previous research has focused on specific seedling quality attributes, obviating the integral effect of nursery culture on overall quality. We studied growing regime, seedling quality, and field performance in nine holm oak stocklots produced in commercial nurseries during two consecutive growing years. Results proved variations in field performance were related to stocklot quality and, hence, to the growing regime practised. This dependence on stock quality may vary with planting site weather: in the drier year, survival was related to attributes like height, water status and K concentration, while, in the second, milder year, only growth performance was related to nutrient concentrations, plant size and water status. Results indicated the following quality standards for height: 12–17 cm, diameter: 3.5–4.8 mm, shoot and root weights: 1.3–1.6 and 2.8–4.7 g, respectively, N–P–K foliar concentrations: over 10–0.9–3.7 mg g−1, respectively and in water status parameters: EMX < 5 MPa and SWDTL > 15%. These attributes can be adjusted using nursery cultural practices in order to meet seedling quality standards for holm oak for planting across similar sites.@@@Water stress

"434","Structure and species composition of novel forests dominated by an introduced species in northcentral Puerto Rico@@@@@@Received: 09 January 2009 Accepted: 09 May 2009 Published: 27 May 2009@@@The African tulip tree, Spathodea campanulata Beauv., is an introduced species forming novel forest types in Puerto Rico. These forests develop naturally after deforestation, agricultural use and land abandonment, and there are many questions as to their ecological characteristics. We sampled structure and species composition of large, small, and juvenile trees (≥10, ≥2.5 to <10, and <2.5 cm diameter at breast height, respectively) in nine secondary forests dominated by S. campanulata on alluvial, karst, and volcanic substrates in northcentral Puerto Rico. No differences were found in S. campanulata forest structure between substrates. Of a total of 79 species found, 17 were introduced. Forests on karst and alluvium had the highest and lowest global species richness, respectively. Species richness increased from large to small to juvenile trees in most sites, but more so on karst. The percentage of introduced species was inversely related to species richness of tree size classes on all substrate types. The dominance of S. campanulata in the large tree size class was highest and lowest in alluvial and volcanic sites, respectively, and decreased from large to small to juvenile trees on all substrate types. Species richness of S. campanulata forests is lower than that of native forests on equivalent substrates. Although land use history affects composition, the juvenile tree species established in S. campanulata forests seems to correspond to the geological substrate were sites are found. This study shows S. campanulata restores forest structure and native tree species on abandoned agriculture and grazing lands in Puerto Rico. Management of these novel forests should consider them as resources were natural processes have the potential of making them more diverse.@@@Introduced species

"435","Comparison of different control-pollination techniques for small-flowered eucalypts@@@@@@Received: 28 July 2008 Accepted: 01 June 2009 Published: 12 June 2009@@@Controlled pollination (CP) is a labour-intensive, but useful procedure applied in tree improvement programmes. However, the high costs involved and relatively low seed yields often obtained has, in most cases, necessitated the use of lower quality, open pollinated seed. The aim of the present study was to compare control-pollination methods for combinations among small-flowered eucalypt species. By making crosses within and among Eucalyptus grandis, E. smithii and E. macarthurii, we compared effectiveness, in terms of seed production and level of genetic contamination, of three CP techniques, namely emasculation of bagged flowers and subsequent pollination of receptive stigmas (Conventional method), emasculation and immediate pollination of stigmas with induced receptivity followed by bagging (One Stop Pollination), and pollination of cut styles without emasculation and bagging (Artificially Induced Protogyny). One tree of each species was used as the female in these crosses. Although Artificially Induced Protogyny using ripe and semi-ripe buds produced the highest seeds/flower pollinated in the majority of crosses carried out in this study, the technique, when performed on green buds, resulted in the highest capsule abortion. Molecular analysis using microsatellite markers also revealed that progeny from the Artificially Induced Protogyny method, when using green and semi-ripe buds, were highly contaminated by self- and external pollen. Of the three CP-techniques tested, One Stop Pollination had the lowest genetic contamination. However, this technique also had one of the lowest seed yields, while the Conventional method was intermediate in performance.@@@One Stop Pollination

The objective was to assess whether or not absence of fungal inoculants restricted seedling survival, growth, nutrient uptake and EcM formation in the first 2 years after out-planting in Jambi. Inoculation with EcM fungi in nursery had only limited positive effects on growth in height and diameter or N and P uptake, but it enhanced survival in the period 6–24 months after outplanting in all plots. With or without nursery stage inoculation, S. selanica and S. lamellata can be used for enrichment planting or reforestation in Sumatra as the species respond well to high light intensities. Presence of up to five morphotypes of EcM confirmed the availability of inoculum also in second generation rubber agroforests. Internal transcribe spacer sequencing revealed no S. columnare could be identified from the ectomycorrhizal roots of S. lamellata and S. selanica.@@@Agroforestry

We investigated the effects of seedling size (small and large) and container types (small [Lannen 121], medium [Lannen 81] and large [Forestry Tube]) in the nursery and the effects of mammal browsing after planting on growth of Eucalyptus globulus in Tasmania’s Southern Forests. After planting, seedlings were either exposed to browsing or protected from browsing by wire-mesh cages until age 6 months. Low browsing pressure resulted in around 20% and 5–10% of foliage being browsed in the large and small size categories, respectively, between 1 and 3 months after planting the uncaged treatment. 6 months after planting, height growth increment was lower, and 4 years after planting, mortality was higher in uncaged large than caged large seedling treatments. Six and twelve months after planting, seedlings raised in Forestry Tube containers had significantly greater height increment and root collar diameter relative to other treatments. By 4 years after planting, trees of the small seedling treatment had significantly greater diameter than those of the large seedling treatment, but there was no effect of container type treatment. Four years after planting there was no effect on diameter growth by browsing of <30% of foliage up to 3 months after planting, although there was greater incidence of double leaders in trees that had been browsed as seedlings. Small seedlings produced more growth 4 years after planting than large seedlings of E. globulus.@@@Eucalyptus

Genetic diversity in this tree species was observed in stone/seed-related traits and in vitro responses of cultured nodal segments from plants of eight different populations representing natural forests, fragmented forests and plantations. Variance analysis showed significant differences between populations for these traits. However, it was not possible to separate the different populations using these traits by multivariate analysis, even after environmental variation was reduced over six subcultures. Genetic diversity was therefore analysed using molecular markers. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers yielded 95% polymorphic loci among the eight populations and UPGMA analysis enabled separation of these populations on the basis of their genetic distances. Diversity was also analyzed using population genetics parameters like Nei’s genetic diversity and gene differentiation. Nei’s genetic diversity was 0.29 between populations and 0.11 within populations. AMOVA analysis indicated 41 and 59% within- and between-population genetic diversity, respectively. Mantel test suggested that genetic differentiation between six Indian populations was positively correlated to geographic distance (r = 0.626, P = 0.029). Assessment of the genetic variation in G. arborea populations is an important step in selection of conservation strategies for this species since diversity forms the basis for species adaptation.@@@ISSR

Tree seedlings establishing beneath five framework tree species: Erythrina subumbrans (Hassk.) Merr., Hovenia dulcis Thunb., Melia toosendan Sieb. & Zucc., Prunus cerasoides D.Don and Spondias axillaries Roxb., were surveyed. Five trees of each species were selected in the 8-year-old trial plots. Birds visiting each tree were observed to determine possible seed dispersal activities. Thirty-six tree seedling species were found beneath the selected trees, of which 11 were wind-dispersed and 25 were animal-dispersed. The population density of animal-dispersed tree seedlings was higher than the wind-dispersed seedlings beneath all selected framework trees. The sample plots beneath P. cerasoides supported the highest population density of tree seedlings. Forty-nine bird species were recorded visiting the framework trees between July 2006 and June 2007. Non-frugivorous birds were recorded more frequently than the frugivorous birds. The effects of birds on seedling recruitment were different among each of the selected framework tree. Bigger trees, which attracted high number of birds by providing food resources, roosting and nesting sites may increase the seed deposition more than smaller trees with fewer attractants.@@@Birds

Patagonia@@@@@@Received: 09 May 2008 Accepted: 26 January 2009 Published: 11 February 2009 Issue Date: July 2009@@@One of the main concerns of afforestation with exotic fast-growing species is their higher soil water consumption compared with the native vegetation they replace. In this regard, sites downstream of the plantations may suffer temporal or permanent droughts. Under this hypotheses, soil water use of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plantations and natural woodlands or shrublands (“ñirantales”) was evaluated in two sites during two growing seasons in El Foyel Valley (Río Negro province), Patagonia Argentina. Two methodological approaches were applied: water balances and sapflow measurements. Douglas-fir forests doubled the leaf area index (LAI) of the native forests (12.6 and 5.1 m2 m−2, respectively). Methodological problems were found while constructing water balances because a non-quantified influx of water to the soil was detected in all systems at the beginning and end of the growing season. This flux was not in correlation with precipitation input demonstrating the geological complexity of the valley. For this reason, caution has to be paid to water balance results. However, we have confidence on sapflow measurements, which indicated, as suggested by the water balances, that there are no differences in transpiration between systems (average of 4.8–3.6 mm day−1 for the exotic and native forests, respectively) in spite of Douglas-fir plantations having twofold LAI than native ñirantales. However, a different response of transpiration to atmospheric demand was found between the exotic and native species, suggesting differences in their ecophysiological characteristics.@@@Soil water fluxes

DC (synonym C. nurvala) is a high-value Indian medicinal tree. The multiple uses of C. magna have resulted in its over-exploitation. Erratic seed germination combined with destructive harvesting and habitat destruction in the form of deforestation has added to the enormity of the problem. Therefore, the need for conservation of this plant is vital. Development of an efficient micropropagation protocol will play a significant role in meeting the requirement of quality planting material for commercial cultivation thereby conserving the species in its natural habitat. In the present study, shoot multiplication was achieved by culturing single node segments derived from a field grown tree on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium supplemented with 2.66 μM N6-benzyladenine, 1.39 μM Kinetin (Kn), 0.57 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 3% sucrose and 0.2% gelrite. 96% rooting was achieved within 22 days by culturing the in vitro formed shoots on half strength MS medium with 11.42 μM IAA, 9.8 μM indole-3-butyric acid, 0.46 μM Kn and 198.25 μM phloroglucinol. Following a simple hardening procedure involving sequential transfer of plants to a greenhouse, polyhouse, and shade net, the tissue-cultured plants were transferred to the field where the survival rate was 100%. To this date 500 plants have been produced. Inter simple sequence repeat analysis has confirmed genetic uniformity of the tissue-cultured plants.@@@Axillary branching

Hybrid sweetgum proembryogenic masses (PEMs) constitutively overexpressing ECS were able to grow in the presence of 50 μM HgCl2, which inhibited wild-type PEMs, but plantlets regenerated from the PEMs had abnormal form and did not survive for more than a few weeks following germination. In contrast, mature somatic embryos generated from PEMs constitutively overexpressing merA9 and merA18 converted to normal plantlets on germination medium containing 25 μM HgCl2, while control embryos were killed on 25 μM Hg(II)-medium.

Forest ecosystems can be carbon sources or sinks and are therefore integrated in international climate policy. Forest-related carbon mitigation projects are threatened by climate change through altered environmental conditions and forest processes, as well as through synergistic effects of climate change impacts with already existing socioeconomic and environmental stressors. Data on risk management and adaptation strategies were collected by a survey of 28 current forest projects targeting climate change mitigation. Ten of these represent the officially implemented afforestation (A) and reforestation (R) activities under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, the official methodologies for AR activities under the CDM (Scope 14) were examined for potential climate change adaptation requirements. As a result, the adaptation of forest mitigation projects to climate change is found to be insufficient. A systematic approach for the inclusion of climate change risk management and adaptation is developed and guidelines for the design of “climate-change-proof” afforestation, reforestation and deforestation avoidance projects are proposed. A broader mainstreaming of the issue is required and clear policy regulations are necessary, especially for the post-Kyoto process.@@@Climate change

Willd. is an African leguminous multipurpose tree species belonging to subfamily Mimosoideae and subgenus Aculeiferum, highly valued for gum arabic production. This study estimated the genetic diversity within and among Kenyan populations of the species in the Bulla Sambul, Kutulo, Wamba and Meisori populations based on 12 quantitative traits, which included; tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), number of branches, bark thickness, gum weight and various pod and seed traits on 20 randomly selected trees in every population. Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) and the dendrogram distinctively divided the populations into two groups; Wamba and Meisori in one group while Bulla Sambul and Kutulo in the other, indicating geographical structuring of the genetic variability. The trees were larger, taller with greater pod and seed traits in the Wamba and Meisori than the Bulla Sambul and Kutulo populations. Contrarily, trees had lighter seeds, more branches with higher gum weight in the Kutulo and Bulla Sambul than the Wamba and Meisori populations. The Shannon–Weaver diversity index (H), depicted 1,000-seed weight as the most varied trait across the populations. These findings provide essential information on the genetic diversity of the species, necessary for delineation of particular zones for seed sources for germplasm conservation, selection for domestication and improved gum arabic production.@@@Acacia senegal

In order to establish a protocol for controlled mycorrhization of Pinus halepensis with the edible fungus Lactarius deliciosus, several factors such as fertilisation (35, 60 or 120 mg total N and 13.5, 27 or 54 mg total P), potting substrate (sphagnum peat or sphagnum peat/vermiculite) and fungal inoculum (mycelial slurry produced in a bioreactor, alginate beads or peat/vermiculite) were assessed. The most effective inoculum was mycelial slurry at a dose of 10 ml/plant. The two potting substrates assessed were compatible with mycorrhiza formation. The greatest number of mycorrhized seedlings was obtained with a moderate level of N (35 mg/plant) or P fertilisation (27 mg/plant).

After 2 year of establishment and growth, they were examined to identify suitable clone of shisham at nursery stage. Clones were studied for growth (height and basal diameter), chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and biochemical contents (chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll, free amino acids, total soluble proteins, total soluble sugars, starch and reducing sugar) in the leaves. Clone C2 and C3 (Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India) had the highest growth and the chlorophyll fluorescence rate among examined clones. Between these two clones, C2 gave the highest response on height, basal diameter and Fv/Fm. Except free amino acids, all other biochemical contents were greater in the clones belonging to Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India. Growth parameters, i.e. height and basal diameter increment at nursery stage had a positive correlation with all the studied parameters, except free amino acid and total soluble protein. These findings have demonstrated that there are remarkable clonal variations in growth, physiological and biochemical responses at nursery stage. Thus, physiological and biochemical markers can enhance selection efficiency, in addition to growth characteristics such as height and basal diameter as these have practical value in the tree improvement. The study suggests that clones of Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, India had the best performance and could be further tested in plantation programs.@@@Clonal ramets

Response to AMF and rhizobial inoculation was studied in monocultures of Plathymenia reticulata and mixed plantations with both Tabebuia heptaphylla and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in a sandy soil during two consecutive years. P. reticulata height and diameter and mycorrhizal colonization and AMF diversity were measured in dry and rainy periods. The inoculated treatment of E. camaldulensis, T. heptaphylla and P. reticulata mixed plants showed higher height and diameter growth of P. reticulata used as well as increased root colonization and AMF spore numbers. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera: Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, Gigaspora and Scutellospora, with Glomus dominating. Agroforestry practices including use of leguminous tree P. reticulata effectively maintained AMF spore numbers in soils and high AMF colonization levels compared with monocultures, proving an efficient system for productivity and sustainability.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

It produces a substance known as taxol, which is useful in treatment of ovarian cancer. Because seed production for this dioecious tree is limited, and seed germination is extremely difficult, the use of cuttings could facilitate propagation of this species. With the intention of massively propagating individuals selected for taxol content, two trials were established in which the effect of substrate temperature (average temperatures 18 and 23°C), age (i.e., young vs. old shoots) and management of cuttings, as well as clone variation in rooting capacity, were evaluated. Low temperature favored rooting (53 vs. 34% on average for the two trials); younger shoots rooted three times (61 vs. 23%) more than mature ones, while basal wounding did not affect rooting capacity. A wide variation was found in rooting capacity of clones (8–76%), which could be associated with genetic or physiological differences among donor trees.@@@Age of cuttings

The study concerned an unmanaged forest, a stand clear-cut in 1996 and another clear-cut in 2001. ECM colonization of beech roots showed seasonal dynamics in the disturbed areas, but the percentage of roots colonized by ECM was not always related to the accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates. The composition of ECM communities differed between different stands and 40% of ECM morphotypes only occurred in disturbed ecosystems. However, comparable numbers of different ECM morphotypes (24, 25) were found in the three beech stands. This finding indicates that ECM diversity was quite high and similar within disturbed and unmanaged areas. This finding suggests that (1) ECM diversity was not affected by the size and age of trees and (2) the potential of ECM inocula remained high within clear-cut areas. Consequently, the introduction of ECM inocula by silvicultural practices would not be needed to improve the regeneration of clear-cut areas described in our study.@@@Beech forests

Ground cover with black plastic mulching resulted in the best growth and quality in A. lasiocarpa; the least favourable treatment was when grasses were allowed to grow close to the trees. Unless measures were taken to remove this competing vegetation, the ground cover grew over the trees, smothering 94% of them. A. nordmanniana plants grew to the same height on plots with no weed control as on plots with thorough weed eradication. Stem diameter decreased on plots with ground vegetation compared to seedlings grown in the weed-free environment. The use of Trifolium repens as ground cover decreased height growth by 30% compared to thorough weed control.

The highest induction frequency for somatic embryogenesis was achieved with MS medium (Murashige and Skoog in Physiol Plant 15:473–497 1962) supplemented with 2.5 μM TDZ using torpedo-shaped embryos (3–5 mm in length) as explants. In addition, induction medium was supplemented with 0.8 g l−1 casein, 0.4 g l−1 glutamine, and 10 g l−1 sucrose. Somatic embryos (SEs) initiated from root tips or hypocotyls without callus formation. SEs were maintained and multiplied via secondary somatic embryogenesis. Embryo maintenance medium was similar to induction medium except that TDZ was reduced to 0.5 μM. Secondary embryogenesis was enhanced by supplementation of 5 g l−1 activated charcoal in the culture.

On former decking areas that were built after a summer harvest, aspen regeneration was 50% lower and root death 35% greater compared to former decking areas of a fall harvest. Duration of log storage after a fall harvest had little effect on aspen regeneration; short (1.5–3 months) or long (11 months) storage resulted in similar regeneration. Slash load was greatly increased on decking areas while root wounding and soil bulk density were only slightly increased compared to controls. For best management practices, log storage after summer harvest should be avoided especially when logs are kept over the growing period when suckering occurs. Additionally, removing the interwoven mat of slash covering decking areas and limiting machine traffic to frozen soil will ensure vigorous suckering.@@@Populus tremuloides

Kuntze, A. mangium Wild, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Alp., Leucaena hybrid (L×L), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were investigated to determine whether parameters of nursery seedling stock quality could be used to predict their field performance in a plantation irrigated with treated waste-water to produce fodder and wood. Plants were grown in the nursery in two contrasting rooting substrates (ordinary nursery soil and sand), predicted to have different effects on resource allocation. Three categories of morphological indicators were measured, i.e., plant dimensions (height, diameter, root length), plant weights (shoot, root and whole plant weights) and indices (sturdiness quotient ‘SQ’, shoot:root dry weight ratio ‘SRR’ and Dickson’s quality index ‘DQI’). In the nursery, all species performed better in the ordinary nursery soil for all growth parameters except root length. Thus ordinary nursery substrate appeared superior to sand in terms of plant quality. However, a follow up at plantation phase revealed that only some morphological attributes or ratios were suitable to predict field performance for the five tested species in irrigated plantation. In addition, the effect of the substrate observed at the nursery stage had disappeared 12 months after out planting due to the availability of water and nutrients provided by the treated waste water used for the irrigation. The results showed that root collar diameter and DQI appeared to be the most appropriate indicators to predict the outplanting performance of the five tested species in a short-rotation irrigated plantation in semi-arid Burkina Faso. The former measure is simpler and non-destructive.@@@Irrigation

However, the impact of this shading on the seedling quality and transplanting performance of Mediterranean species is not well known. We studied the effect of nursery shading on pre-planting features and post-planting performance of two Mediterranean tree species: the shade-intolerant pioneer Pinus halepensis and the shade-tolerant late-successional Quercus ilex. We grew one-year-old seedlings of both species under 100, 40 and 5% full sunlight. Shade had a low impact on the morphology and physiology of Q. ilex seedlings. In pines, only the deep shade treatment produced low quality seedlings with poor root development. In both species, transference to high light at planting in autumn did not impose any additional stress than that caused by frosts, but initial root growth was impaired in the two shaded treatments in pine. Post-planting growth and survival of oak seedlings showed no difference between treatments. Pine seedlings grown in deep shade showed higher mortality and lower growth after planting than those grown in full sun and intermediate light treatments, while intermediate light only reduced growth. For the nursery culture of Q. ilex seedlings, we advise using low light levels during summer to save water without impairing field performance. In P. halepensis, seedlings should be cultured under full sunlight conditions to maximize post-planting growth, but they can be cultured under intermediate light without impairing survival.@@@Chlorophyll fluorescence

Temperature environment (15, 25, 30 or 35 ± 2°C) had no effect on the cellular stages in root formation of the Slash × Caribbean Pine hybrid over 16 weeks as determined by histology. Initially callus cells formed in the cortex, then tracheids developed and formed primordia leading to external roots. However, speed of development followed a growth curve with the fastest development occurring at 25°C and slowest at 15°C with rooting percentages at week 12 of 80 and 0% respectively. Cutting survival was good in the three cooler temperature regimes (>80%) but reduced to 59% at 35°C. Root formation appeared to be dependant on the initiation of tracheids because all un-rooted cuttings had callus tissue but no tracheids, irrespective of temperature treatment and clone.@@@Propagation

The hypothesis that post-severance treatments and propagation environment do not temporally affect the rooting ability of leafy stem cuttings was rejected. Each of the four replicate blocks used consisted of 12 treatments from two crossed factors, substrate × auxins. Time (weeks) after insertion of cuttings in nonmist propagators was used as the third factor. Substrate × auxin × time had highly significant (P = 0.0022), whereas substrate × time and auxin × time had non-significant (P = 0.0518–0.0549) effects on rooting percentage, respectively.

A full understanding of positive and negative, i.e. allelopathic, interactions between crops and forest trees is necessary for producing crops and conserving forests especially within the threatened Mediterranean forest ecosystems. The present study explored the allelopathic effects of green and senescent leaf and soil extracts of two agroforestry trees—Pinus halepensis and Quercus coccifera—on the germination of wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and fababean as the major grain crops of Jordan. Results revealed that allelopathic effects reduced seed germination of these crops. Germination reduction reached a maximum of 75% in fababean treated with green extracts of Q. coccifera and differed among crops and extract sources, but not between tree species. Comparing between green and senescent leaf and soil extract, regarding their effect on germination percentage, it was noticed that these effects were similar in some crops and were different in others. Germination responses were generally different between cereals and legumes where cereals tend to be less affected by allelopathic influences than legumes, especially fababean. We suggest using cereals such as wheat and barley in agroforestry practices in the Mediterranean region of Jordan.@@@Allelopathy

Mortality shortly after planting is often associated with inadequate hydration of transplants. Seedlings can be hardened to the drought conditions they may experience after transplanting by exposing them to controlled drought conditions in the nursery. Eucalyptus pilularis Sm. seedlings were drought hardened by providing nil (severe treatment) or half (mild treatment) the daily irrigation routinely received (control treatment) for up to two non-consecutive days per week during the last 4 weeks of growth in the nursery. Drought hardening reduced stem diameter, seedling leaf area, leaf area per root biomass and seedling quality measured by the Dickson quality index, but increased root:shoot ratio. Hardened seedlings had lower stomatal conductance and leaf water potential on the days they received less irrigation that the control treatment. Hardened seedlings had greater stomatal conductance and were less water stressed than seedlings experiencing drought for the first time indicating hardened seedlings had adjusted physiologically to drought. Survival after transplanting in the controlled drought environment in a glasshouse was enhanced by the hardening treatments. Non hardened seedlings that had had their upper leaves manually removed immediately prior to transplanting to reduce leaf area (top-clipped) had similar survival to hardened seedlings. Stomatal conductance and leaf water potential after transplanting were higher in hardened and top-clipped seedlings than unhardened control seedlings or vegetative cuttings. Survival in the field trial was over 95% for all treatments, possibly as rain fell within 4 days of planting and follow-up rain occurred in the subsequent weeks. Neither the hardened or top-clipped seedlings planted in the field trial had reduced growth, increased propensity to form double leaders or worse stem form than control seedlings when measured at age 3 years.@@@Eucalyptus

Previous studies in southern Ecuador of 115 tree species revealed that only three species were not associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Seedlings of tropical tree species raised in the nursery may need to be associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to survive transplantation shock in higher numbers. Methods for establishing plantations with native tree species are not yet established for Ecuador. Thus, we investigated the feasibility of using mycorrhizal roots of seedlings of Inga acreana, Tabebuia chrysantha, Cedrela montana and Heliocarpus americanus that had trapped mycorrhizal fungi from forest humus in the nursery to inoculate C. montana and H. americanus with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Inoculation with either a mixture of mycorrhizal roots from the four species or only with mycorrhizal roots from the same tree species were compared with effects of moderate fertilization. Assessment of plant growth and mycorrhizal status of 6-months-old Cedrela montana and Heliocarpus americanus revealed an improvement in growth and diverse associated fungi through mycorrhizal root inoculation in comparison with moderate fertilization. Moderate fertilization did not suppress mycorrhization.@@@Native mycorrhizal fungi

This study tested the effect of flower density, as well as two common irrigation techniques on capsule and seed set. Ramets with high flower density had significantly lower capsule set (69.7%) than those with low flower density (81.7%). In a regulated deficit irrigation trial, the non-irrigated ramets set a higher proportion of capsules (63.6%) than the ramets that received conventional irrigation (CI) (51.4%). In a partial root zone drying (PRD) trial, capsule set was highest in the absence of irrigation (74.7%) followed by the PRD treatment (67.8%) and then CI (53.7%). The CI treatment tended to produce the highest number of seed per capsule. Increased water availability resulted in increased vegetative growth, which was associated with higher levels of abortion in developing capsules but those surviving tended to have higher seed set. It is argued that the observed effects of irrigation and flower density can be explained by resource competition between vegetative and reproductive growth as well as competition among reproductive structures themselves.@@@Eucalyptus globulus

Predictions were made at both the local and microsite scales. Percent sand (R 2 = 0.352, P = 0.001) was the best single predictor of hybrid poplar productivity, showing a curved relationship. Soil pH also showed a curved but weaker relationship with hybrid poplar productivity (R 2 = 0.133, P = 0.100). Maximum tree productivity occurred at sand contents between 55 and 70% and pH values near 6. Other variables, including foliar nutrient concentrations, foliar δ13C, electrical conductivity, depth of the A horizon and total chemistry of the soil, were also related to hybrid poplar productivity at the local and microsite scales. However, all of these variables were correlated to either soil texture (percent sand) or pH. At the microsite scale within plantations, percent sand was the most important predictor of tree productivity and explained more than 50% of the variability within plantations, although the relationship varied by plantation. In plantations with fine textures, sandier microsites were associated with increased growth while in sandy plantations, finer textured microsites were more productive. As a whole, the growth of the hybrid poplar clone Brooks6 appears to be mostly influenced by a combination of soil water and nutrient availability, the former being impacted by soil texture and the latter being governed by soil pH.@@@Brooks6

Over a 3-year period, we studied the pattern of survival and functional performance of seedlings of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. in a montane forest in central Spain, which is the southern edge of the natural range of Q. petraea. After a mast year of the two species, 72 plots were established in six microhabitats spanning a range of overstorey canopy closure: closed, partial and open canopies dominated by either Q. petraea or Q. pyrenaica adult trees. Seedlings of each species naturally emerged beneath the conspecific-dominated canopies. The second and third years of study were extremely dry. Three years after emergence, the greatest seedling survival occurred beneath the partial canopy of Q. pyrenaica trees (8%) and the lowest (0%) beneath the closed canopies of Q. pyrenaica and Q. petraea. Survival for Q. pyrenaica increased linearly with understorey light across the range of 10–35% Global Site Factor. Plant water deficit (estimated by leaf water potential) was high across microhabitats, and increased with light availability for Q. pyrenaica. Potential for photosynthesis (estimated by the electron transport rate of photosystem II) decreased with canopy closure; and potential for light harvesting (e.g. specific leaf area (SLA) and chlorophyll concentration) increased with closure. Extreme water deficit could be the main contributor to seedling death in the more open microhabitats, whereas light level was insufficient to maintain carbon balance under the water-stressful conditions existing beneath the closed tree canopies. Seedling establishment appears to be a limiting factor for the recruitment of both oaks within this forest in a wide range of microhabitats, especially for the more drought-sensitive Q. petraea. Moderate reductions of tree canopy cover can improve seedling establishment, but extreme summer droughts can prevent the success of any silvicultural practice made.@@@Summer drought

With decreasing water potential caused by increasing concentrations of PEG 6000, germination percentage and germination index decreased gradually; the decrease was especially prominent under the serious water stress from PEG −0.6 MPa. In contrast, osmotic regulation substances (free proline and soluble sugar contents), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and activities of antioxidant enzyme (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase) increased markedly with decreased water potential. Similarly, the values in all parameters under −0.6 MPa PEG treatment were markedly higher than the control and −0.2 MPa PEG treatment. These results suggested that P. asperata seed germination was insensitive to water stress. In addition, seeds pretreated with GA had increased tolerance to water stress as measured by germination percentage and germination index, osmotic regulation substance, and antioxidant enzyme activities.@@@Antioxidant enzymes

Plant growth was assessed periodically at 1, 2, 3, 12 and 18 months whereas nodulation, shoot and root dry weights were assessed at 12 and 18 months after planting (MAP). Un-inoculated seedlings of all the six species died at 12 months after planting. Results of growth assessments were variable with significant differences (P < 0.05) between C. calothyrsus Meissn provenances (Flores and San Ramón) and C. juzepczukii Standley in height at 1, 2 and 3 MAP.

This legume tree can be colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi but inoculation is not routinely practiced. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of AM fungi and four isolates of the ECM fungus Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker and Couch (Pt) in promoting growth of A. mangium seedlings under glasshouse conditions. AM inoculants were: Glomus etunicatum, G. fasciculatum, G. macrocarpum and Gigaspora margarita and mixed species extracted from rhizosphere soil of a Populus stand in Suwon (AMKFRI), and Carex (AMM6) and Populus (AMM7) growing in mine tailings in Korea. Pisolithus isolates were from Philippines (PtPhil) and Korea (PtKFRI, PtMKACC, PtKACC). Generally, ECM fungi promoted height and diameter growth of A. mangium more than the AM inoculants. The Korean Pisolithus increased plant dry weight by 122–145%, mixed AM inoculants by 61–97%, and Glomus and Gigaspora by 45–72% over the control. PtKACC gave the highest root colonization and promoted the highest growth and concentration of most nutrients. Mycorrhizal root colonization was positively correlated with plant dry weight, Na, Fe and Cu concentrations and N, P, K, Ca, Na, Fe and Cu contents. In conclusion, the results provide strong evidence for benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation on A. mangium seedlings under glasshouse conditions. The Korean Pisolithus isolates (particularly PtKACC), and two AM fungi (AMKFRI and AMM6) are potential mycorrhizal inoculants but their effectiveness and persistence should be determined on degraded lands in tropical countries where A. mangium is being planted for rehabilitation.@@@Acacia mangium

We examined the effect of midstory and understory removal on the establishment and 3-year development of natural and artificial sources of pin oak (Q. palustris Muenchh.) advance reproduction in bottomland forests in southeastern Missouri, USA. Midstory and understory removals increased the photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) reaching the seedling layer from about 3 to 15%. This increased light did not increase the density of natural pin oak advance reproduction compared to control, but it increased the survival and nominally increased the growth of the natural pin oak advance reproduction. Where the midstory and understory had been removed, underplanted RPM® container stock and bareroot pin oak stock maintained high survival, but of the two only the RPM® stock maintained positive height and diameter growth while bareroot stock suffered some growth reductions. Pin oaks originating from the direct seeding of stratified acorns sown in the spring had low germination and survival, but the survivors had growth rates similar to those of natural seedlings in thinned stands. Applying triclopyr to competitors in the ground flora layer only nominally increased PAR but reduced the percent survival and marginally increased the growth of natural and artificial pin oak. We conclude that artificial reproduction may be used to further increase the probability of achieving adequate numbers of the desired species in the future. Bareroot seedlings may not perform as well as RPM® seedlings and natural seedlings already present. However, bareroot and RPM® seedlings remained significantly larger than the natural seedlings after 3 years.@@@Midstory removal

Natural regeneration of D. melanoxylon is limited due to poor seed viability and germination. The effects of age of donor plant, indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) treatment and cutting position on rooting of stem cuttings were investigated. The effect of age of donor plant was significant (P < 0.001) only for percent rooting, position effect was significant for all studied parameters, and IBA treatment at 300 ppm was insignificant only for percent callusing. Interactive effects of cutting position × age of donor and cutting position × IBA treatment were significant for percent rooting and root number per cuttings while interactive effect of age × IBA was significant only for percent rooting. Observed difference in rooting performance could be due to uneven distribution of root promoting and inhibiting substances with respect to age of donor plant and IBA which intensified root formation. Cuttings from juvenile donor plant performed better in all rooting parameters than mature donor plant. The highest percentages in rooting were (71.11%) and (24.42%) for cuttings from juvenile and mature donor plants, respectively. IBA treated cuttings produced higher percentage rooting, number of roots and root length than untreated cuttings which revealed a strong IBA influence on rooting ability of stem cuttings in D. melanoxylon. It was concluded that stem cuttings should be taken from juvenile donor plants and basal cutting position should be used to produce high quality planting stock material for the afforestation and conservation programme of D. melanoxylon.@@@Dalbergia melanoxylon

Root donor plants were produced either under greenhouse or open grown conditions. Root cuttings were periodically collected from donor plants that had been stored for various lengths of time in cold storage (up to 180 days), or that were stored dormant in cold storage (up to 150 days) and then grown for another full growing season. Longer storage of donor plants produced only slightly smaller rootlings and resulted in slightly lower establishment success. Rootling establishment success was severely depressed (down to 18% establishment success) when cuttings were collected during the active growth period of donor plants. Carbohydrate reserves did not influence rootling establishment success but did affect root and shoot growth performance. It appears that other factors, such as hormone levels, may be more important in rootling establishment success.@@@Populus tremuloides

The rate and degree of riparian restoration, and hence stream restoration, depends in part upon afforestation practices. Successful afforestation is determined largely by the rates of survivorship and growth of the tree species planted or recruited in a riparian zone. This study was part of a project involving the restoration of a channelized section of Wilson Creek located in the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, Nelson County, Kentucky. Riparian restoration activities focused on reestablishing a native riparian corridor using American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. subintegerrima), and pin oak (Quercus palustris). This study evaluated techniques for improving the growth and survivorship of planted seedlings along Wilson Creek. Specifically, two tree shelter types (Tubex® vs. continental mesh), with or without herbicide treatments, were compared. Additionally, the influence of these techniques on debris retention within the riparian zone was also examined. Results showed that use of tree shelters significantly increased the growth of seedlings (but not survivorship), provided physical protection especially during heavy flooding events, and accelerated woody debris retention. Both Tubex® and continental mesh tree shelters were effective in enhancing seedling growth, with Tubex® shelters yielding significantly better growth when combined with herbicide to control competing vegetation. Thus, the most cost effective choice may depend on the environmental setting and ability to combine the shelters with other growth enhancing treatments.@@@Riparian restoration

Wide variation in its survival, growth and form, together with issues related to site selection and intensive silvicultural management, limit progress in its domestication and commercial development. To determine the effect of genetics on these traits, five blackwood progeny trials in northern Tasmania, Australia, aged between 15 and 19 years were assessed. All trials contained a variety of open-pollinated, single-tree, family collections from Tasmania, with one trial containing a selection of provenances from mainland Australia. Significant genetic variation in survival, growth and form were found. This variation was partly explained by broad scale adaptive differences across the wide geographic distribution of blackwood. Blackwood from the tropical northern range of the species had poor survival in cool temperate Tasmania. Significant differences in survival between Tasmanian seedlots were also observed. Among the Tasmanian seedlots, those from low altitudes grew better than those from high altitudes, while those from the north-east of Tasmania had significantly better growth rates than seedlots from the south-east. Seedlots from the north-west seed zone had intermediate growth rates. Significant genetic differences in the proportion of trees with single stems, and the number of large branches in the lower stem were found between Tasmanian seedlots. Early-age seedlot height was significantly positively correlated with mid-age diameter. Stem form was improved under nurse crops, but even open-grown blackwood had low percentages of trees of excellent form. These results indicate that at the broad scale, climatic matching of seed source with planting site is clearly important, however, within Tasmania there was no evidence that seedlots collected from the same region as the trials outperformed those from other regions.@@@Australian blackwood

"474","Vermicompost enhances germination of the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.)@@@@@@Received: 23 December 2008 Accepted: 12 October 2009 Published: 30 October 2009 Issue Date: May 2010@@@We investigated the effect of vermicompost on the germination and early development of six different progenies of the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). We compared the effects of incorporating solid vermicompost into the potting media to those of vermicompost water extract. The incorporation of vermicompost in the growing media of maritime pine increased germination by 16%, and particularly, addition of vermicompost water extract produced the best results. Plants germinated with vermicompost showed higher N content as compared to control plants, and this could have determined the faster maturation of the treated seedlings. Since the best effects on pine germination were observed after application of vermicompost water extract, other mechanisms, rather than the physical amelioration of the substrate, such as the presence of water soluble nutrients and organic compounds (i.e. humic acids and plant growth regulating substances) in the vermicompost, might be involved in the promotion of germination. We also report variation in the response of the different pine progenies to vermicompost application thereby confirming the necessity of taking into account genetic variability in order to study the potential of vermicompost and other biologically-active organic materials as a potting amendments.@@@Forest nursery

"475","Silvicultural and economic aspects of pure and mixed native tree species plantations on degraded pasturelands in humid Costa Rica@@@@@@Received: 18 April 2009 Accepted: 09 October 2009 Published: 31 October 2009 Issue Date: May 2010@@@Reforestation of degraded land in tropical regions provides one means of restoring ecosystems and improving rural livelihoods. Most plantations in humid tropical regions are established in pure plots, including few species of high commercial value, generally exotics. The present study compares growth and economic viability of 15–16 year-old trees of native species in pure and mixed plantations on degraded pasturelands at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species with the best growth were Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, and Hieronyma alchorneoides. The mixed plantations performed better than pure plantations for all growth variables considered, including height, diameter at breast height, volume, and aboveground biomass. Mixed plantations outperformed pure plantations economically, with Net Present Value (NPV) of $1,124 to $8,155/ha and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 7.7–15.6% depending on the species mixture. The most profitable pure plantations were those of Vochysia guatemalensis, with NPV and IRR of $6,035/ha and 14.3%, respectively; Hieronyma alchorneoides ($2,654 and 10.8%); and Virola koschnyi ($1,906/ha and 9.22%). These are the estimated benefits that would be accrued at harvest. These projections are realistic since the decision to harvest is generally mandated not just by profit maximization but by economic necessity, thus many small- to medium-scale farmers in Costa Rica harvest plantations prior to the completion of the rotation length. Mixed plantation may be the preferred system for reforestation with native species designed for timber production or carbon sequestration because this system is more economically viable and productive than pure plantations.@@@Degraded lands

Nutrient status can be measured to determine seedling quality, but it can be affected by seedling handling techniques. In this study effects of root preparation technique and storage regime on content of macro nutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg) in fine roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) plants were investigated. The root preparation techniques were: (a) rinse in tap or (b) deionised water, and (c) dry preparation. These techniques were tested on seedlings subjected to four storage regimes: (1) no storage, (2) deep freezing below −20°C, and long-term (3) cold (+1 to +3°C) and (4) frozen (−3 to −4°C) storage. From the results it was concluded that the nutrient status in needles is not sufficient to describe the whole plant nutrient status in stored dormant plants, fine roots should also be included. The results also showed that deep freezing of fine roots before nutrient analyses should be avoided. Losses of K, P, S, and Mg were substantial with this method. Deionised water or dry preparation is preferred since tap water contains substantial amounts of ions that may affect the analyses.@@@Fine roots

The mini-cuttings technique was used for ex vitro clonal propagation of three sweetgum clones. The semi-hydroponics system for production of propagules was also tested, and the concentration of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) for rooting was evaluated. Three adult clones, produced according to conventional cutting processes, were used as mini-stumps and maintained in semi-hydroponics systems of medium size sand. Ten collections of sprouts were prepared to evaluate the production of semi-hydroponics systems (mini-clonal hedges). Sprouts from collection number six were used at different concentrations of IBA solution (0; 500; 1,000; 3,000 and 6,000 mg l−1) to test the mini-cuttings technique. The high survival rates of mini-stumps after ten collections (96.3%), and high annual production per square meter (~2,953 mini-cuttings) showed that the mini-clonal hedges are viable to conduct sweetgum mini-stumps. The formation of 62.5% of healthy plants after hardening under outdoor conditions showed that sweetgum could be successfully propagated by the mini-cuttings technique.@@@Liquidambar styraciflua

Serotiny is a strategy that increases fire resilience by storing seeds in the canopy, protecting them from heat and delaying their dispersion. Aleppo pine is an important serotinous tree species in the low altitude, near-coastal Mediterranean Basin. Differences in serotinous and non-serotinous cones have been detected previously but in order to resolve a gap in the knowledge on seed adaptation to fire, we focused this study on two fire-prone habitats in southern Italy. Several cones were sampled and opened in an oven at two different temperatures in order to group seeds according to provenance and cone type (serotinous or non-serotinous). The sampled seeds were weighed and their coats were removed. Seed size, embryo diameter and nutritive tissue thickness were recorded. We found that seeds with greater weight and size came from the more humid site and from non-serotinous cones. Also, we observed wax and cutine cells formed a thicker seed coat in seeds from the more humid site using a scanning electron microscope. The scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed higher Si and Ca concentrations in the covers of serotinous seeds. Seeds from different provenance and cone types have anatomic and morphological differences that confer different properties against heating. This knowledge can improve post-fire management and promote restoration tools.@@@Pinus halepensis Mill.

In response to this issue, the effects of land prices, wood transportation costs, site productivity, and discount rates on timber investment returns for pine plantations in the Andean Region in Colombia were estimated. For all the scenarios analyzed, the internal rate of return varied between 6.4 and 15.6%. High site quality with high growth rates were profitable in all scenarios at real discount rates ranging from 8 to 12%, but low site qualities seldom had positive net present values. Less expensive land and locations close to mills had better rates of return. More distant locations, poor quality sites, or areas with high land costs generally did not meet the discount hurdle rates. Site quality, which is the factor most easily manipulated by intensive forest management and improved technology, was substantially more important than land prices and transportation differences in determining timber investment returns.@@@Forest investments

The mean cellulose content of the fast-growing families was significantly higher than that of the slow growing-families (40.0 and 37.1%, respectively), and for individual trees cellulose content was significantly correlated phenotypically with DBH. Wood basic density was significantly lower in the fast-growing group than in the slow-growing group (0.506 and 0.535 g cm−3, respectively), and was significantly negatively correlated phenotypically with DBH. The lignin contents were not significantly different between groups. Cellulose content and wood basic density were not correlated. The main conclusion is that there is no obstacle to combining high growth rate with high cellulose content, for plantation of forests intended mainly for pulpwood.@@@Acetyl bromide method

Height growth rate peaked in August, except at the 0.5-m spacing where it peaked in July and June in years 2 and 3, respectively. Diameter growth rate generally peaked in June. Seasonal growth patterns in mixed clonal stands, relative to those in pure clonal stands, varied by clone. Following early season moisture stress in year 2, growth of a P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa clone declined significantly relative to three P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa × P. deltoides clones; this trend was most evident at the 0.5-m spacing. During this period of moisture stress, P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa had 11 and 36% mortality in pure and mixed stands, respectively, at the 0.5-m spacing; this clone had no mortality at wider spacings during the same period.

Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) seedlings were exposed to ambient and twice ambient levels of atmospheric CO2 prior to inoculation with the fusiform rust fungus (the obligate pathogen Cronartium quercuum f.sp. fusiforme, CQF) or the pitch canker fungus (the facultative pathogen Fusarium circinatum, FC). Additionally, northern red oak seedlings (Quercus rubra; an alternate host of CQF) were exposed to ambient or elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 prior to inoculation with CQF. In all cases, disease incidence (percent of plants infected) and disease severity (proportion of each plant affected) were determined; with the oak seedlings, the latent period (time to sporulation) was also monitored. In general, disease incidence was decreased by exposure to elevated CO2. This exposure also increased the latent period for CQF on oak seedlings. In no instance did exposure to elevated CO2 affect disease severity. This research demonstrated that plants may benefit from exposure to the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere through decreases in fungal disease incidence.@@@Atmospheric carbon dioxide

Don clones in two miniature seed orchards: one in a glasshouse and the other outdoors. There was no statistically significant difference in total seed production between the orchards (P = 0.275, ANOVA). However, the final germination rate of seeds produced in the indoor orchard was significantly lower than that of seeds produced in the outdoor orchard (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon test). The average self-fertilization rate was higher in the indoor orchard (27.2%) than in the outdoor orchard (5.6%), and this parameter was strongly associated with the reduced final germination rates of the seeds harvested in the glasshouse. Pollen contamination was considerably lower in the indoor seed orchard (48.9% in the outdoor seed orchard and 4.4% in the indoor seed orchard). χ2 tests indicated that the paternal contributions of each constituent clone differed significantly in both orchards (P < 0.001 in both cases). The strong variations in paternal contributions among indoor orchard clones was significantly correlated with their respective pollen production capacities (Spearman ρ = 0.693, P < 0.001). To reduce the high self-fertilization rates, we recommend the use of orchard clones with similar pollen production capacity in indoor seed orchards.@@@Male reproductive success

Enrichment plantings are often recommended as a means to supplement species composition within the existing natural reproduction. Previous enrichment efforts have often resulted in low survival and poor growth, generally due to poor planting stock quality and a lack of competition control. In this study, high quality northern red oak seedlings were established on four recently harvested sites in western North Carolina using one of four competition control treatments (untreated, year 1 control, year 2 control or a weed mat) in a 1.2 × 1.2 m area around each seedling with or without a soil fertility amendment. The 3 year results show that competition control and fertilization treatments had few positive impacts on survival and growth of the planted seedlings. These results suggest that either the treatment area was insufficient to adequately release the seedlings, or other factors like belowground competition from existing advance reproduction and/or stump sprouts may be important determinants of the overall success of northern red oak enrichment plantings on recently harvested sites.@@@Quercus rubra

Seedlings of C. equisetifolia were grown in an Alfisol soil and inoculated with G. geosporum, P. polymyxa and Frankia either individually or in combinations. Inoculation of bioinoculants stimulated seedling growth, the efficiency of nutrient uptake and improved seedling quality. However, microbial inoculation generally reduced the efficiency of nutrient utilization in dry matter production (nutrient use efficiency). Inoculation of P. polymyxa or Frankia increased the extent of AM colonization, which resulted in the accumulation of the nutrients. Seedlings inoculated with Frankia and G. geosporum had more, and heavier nodules compared to seedlings inoculated with Frankia alone. Dual inoculation of microbes was more effective than individual inoculations. The growth response of seedlings to inoculation involving all the microbes was greater than the response to either individual or dual inoculations. The results of this study showed that the tetrapartite association could improve the growth, nutrient acquisition and seedling quality of C. equisetifolia under tropical nursery conditions.@@@Actinorhizal

With the aim to establish seedling seed orchards of the species, seed lots of fifteen provenances were imported from Australia and a trial was laid. In the present study the genetic diversity existing in the seed orchard was estimated using ISSR–PCR. Seven ISSR primers amplified 663 amplicons in the size ranging from 255 to 2,711 bp. The total number of polymorphic bands varied from 59 to 123 with 100% polymorphic banding profiles. The average gene diversity (Hj) of all the provenances ranged from 0.0589 to 0.1109 and the total gene diversity estimated was low (H T = 0.130) when compared to the earlier reports from other eucalypts species. Analysis of Molecular Variance partitioned the ISSR variation into inter and intra population components. The inter population component accounted for 55.2% of the variation and the intra population component accounted for 46.3% (P < 0.001). A neighbour-joining analysis was done using the dissimilarity matrix to determine the aggregation of the individuals into clusters. Existence of population structure among the populations was revealed in STRUCTURE analysis but geographical region based clustering was not observed. The assessment of intra and inter genetic variation documented in the present study suggests that, along with the phenotypic traits, knowledge about genetic diversity measured at the DNA level in individuals of seed orchards provide an objective guide for selective culling of trees for maintaining optimal diversity for enhanced genetic gains.@@@AMOVA

The data were from a reforestation study of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) consisting of 288 sample plots, which were measured with respect to regeneration success. The study design included four site-preparation methods (patch scarification, ploughing, prescribed burning and disk trenching) combined with three reforestation methods (sowing, planting with containerized seedlings and planting with bare-rooted transplants). Initial reforestation density was 2,500 spots or seedlings per hectare, and the regeneration success was modeled as probability with two thresholds, namely 500 and 1,100 saplings. On formerly spruce-dominated as well as pine-dominated sites the most cost-effective chain was ploughing and planting with containerized seedlings, when threshold was 1,100 saplings per hectare. However, with threshold of 500 saplings the best performer was ploughing and direct sowing on both sites.@@@Chain of stand establishment

Ex. D.Don is a common under-canopy associate of chir pine and banj oak forests in the Kumaun and Garhwal Himalayas. The species commonly known as Kaiphal is a small moderate sized evergreen dioecious tree. The species is well known for its edible fruit and other by products and has emerged as a potential income generating species in the Kumaun and Garhwal region. The regeneration of Myrica esculenta is poor in natural habitats mainly due to intense anthropogenic pressure on it. To synchronize artificial regeneration of such species exact knowledge of maturity time is essential to avoid the collection of immature and non-viable seeds. Fruits of Myrica esculenta were collected from nine sites varying from lower, mid and high range of species distribution (900–2,100 masl) for assessing seed maturation indicators. Across all the sites the colour change from green to dark red/blackish red appears as one of the indicator of maturity. In addition to the colour change seed maturity and maximum germination was found in seeds when the weight of 100 fruits was between 41 and 60 g, fruit moisture content between 62 and 69% and seed moisture content between 30 and 32%.@@@Seed maturation

This study considered the traditional use of plants for health care by the rural communities in two forested and non-forested regions of Bangladesh. A total of 230 respondents were interviewed accompanied by field observation and voucher specimen collection. Altogether, 68 species of medicinal plants belonging to 38 families distributing over 58 genera were recorded, of which 22 species were common in both regions. Trees were the most commonly utilized growth form and leaves were the most commonly used plant part. Forests and homesteads were the major sources of medicinal plants in forested and non-forested regions, respectively. High use versatility (Relative Importance >1) was represented by 14 species; Emblica officinale L. and Allium sativum L. were the most versatile species. Forty-one individual ailments were treated with the medicinal plants recorded. The ailment categories ‘respiratory problems’ and ‘sexual problems’ received the highest score from the calculation of informants’ consensus factor (F ic) in forested and non-forested regions, respectively.

An experiment was conducted to examine water uptake (grams water per gram of fresh seed) during 48 h after exposure to water. A second experiment investigated the effect of simulated-drought conditions (4% sucrose solution) compared to non-drought conditions (distilled water) on subsequent germination percentage. Seed from rocky habitats had less water uptake than those from control habitats for three of the provenances. However, water uptake was not correlated with subsequent germination. Drought simulation decreased germination but patterns for seed within each provenance were similar to germination under non-drought conditions. With the exception of one provenance, seed from the rocky habitats had lower germination than seed from control habitats. The data suggests some degree of adaptation to environmental conditions although variability was very high within each provenance’s habitat types. This is of particular importance when considering potential impacts of climate change and the anticipated migration of species due to changes in habitat.@@@Pinus nigra

Wood specific gravity of chir pine before and after removal of extractives from wood increment cores was assessed from a 22-years-old progeny test in Himachal Pradesh, India. These values averaged 0.433 and 0.425, respectively. A large amount of genetic variation among the 58 half-sib families was found as indicated by range of values, additive coefficient of variation, variance estimates and narrow-sense heritability values for these traits. Moisture and extractive content averaged 86.259% of oven-dry weight and 2.003% of extractive-free oven-dry weight, respectively. Wood extractive content was highly variable and the family differences were highly heritable (h 2f = 0.5831). There was wide variability in moisture content, but a large portion of it was due to environmental or non-additive component of genetic variation. Heritability on family mean basis was found to be lower than that on individual tree basis for each trait. Estimated gain in specific gravity resulting from 30 to 50% family selection ranged from 0.0080 to 0.0127. Growth data and specific gravity were not significantly correlated implying that selection for higher growth rate would not necessarily result in reduction in wood specific gravity in chir pine.@@@Pinus roxburghii

To negate the effect of environmental variables, a completely randomized block experiment was installed in a normal production run of air-slit containerized white spruce seedlings grown under an unheated polyethylene tunnel. Whereas substrate water content was monitored daily, biweekly measurements of tissue and substrate fertility and seedling morphophysiological variables were made over the course of the growing season. Leaching of mineral nutrients was continuously monitored throughout the experimental period. Reducing volumetric substrate water content from 55 to 30% did not have a significant effect on seedling growth, carbon allocation, tissue nitrogen content, or end-of-season morphology. This irrigation strategy also resulted in a 20% reduction in water usage and, more importantly, reduced the total leachate volume by 65% and the quantity of N leached by 52%. Maintaining rhizosphere water content of (2+0) white spruce seedlings at 40% V/V compromises neither plant growth nor physiological processes. This strategy limits leaching of water and mineral nutrients, and reduces the risk of groundwater contamination, thus enabling growers to meet both quality and environmental standards for seedlings grown in northern forest nurseries.@@@White spruce

The effects of experimental practices to control the woody plant Rhododendron flavum Don., including grubbing, manual cutting, and foliar and cut-stump spraying with imazapyr and triclopyr, were assessed on understory and forest floor biomass and nutrients, as well as soil bulk density and nutrient content. The cut plots had 5, 15, and 38 times greater competing vegetation biomass than did the plots treated with triclopyr, grubbing, and imazapyr, respectively. Because of the increased biomass, the amount of understory N, P, Ca, K, S, and Mg content on the cut plots was also substantially higher when compared to the grubbed, imazapyr-treated, and triclopyr-treated plots. Triclopyr and imazapyr applications brought about two- and threefold greater dead organic matter on the forest floor than did cutting and grubbing, respectively. As a result, forest floor macronutrient contents on the imazapyr- and triclopyr-treated plots were significantly greater than on the cut plots. Five years after treatments, soil bulk density at the 10–20 cm depth on the imazapyr-sprayed plots was about 14% higher than that on other treatments. Herbicides, especially imazapyr and grubbing were effective in controlling rhododendron. Macronutrients stored in the rhododendron were released to the forest floor after vegetation was controlled with herbicides.@@@Fagus orientalis

Its original Pre-European natural range of 38 million ha has been reduced by 95% and it is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the US. The species undergoes a grass stage where no stem development takes place that can last 7 years or longer. Competition control can limit this grass stage and increase economic returns. The amount of competition control cost that equals the cost of the grass stage delay would be the most one would want to expend in reducing the grass stage delay. This breakeven amount can be determined using land expectation value methodology and a simple calculation technique is presented. A case study shows that each additional year of a grass stage delay decreases the bare land value of a longleaf pine stand by about 6% annually. A longleaf pine stand with no grass stage delay worth $2,500 per ha would be worth $1,768 per ha with a 5-year grass stage delay. One could spend up to $478 per ha to eliminate this 5-year grass stage delay and still break-even.@@@Longleaf pine

We measured 100 E. globulus trees at 6.5 years of age on each of a high productivity site (Albany) and a low productivity site (Esperance), sampling 16 full-sib families and seven open-pollinated ‘check’ seedlots. On each tree we assessed pilodyn penetration at 1.3 m and BD of: (a) the outer 10 mm which was penetrated by the pilodyn pin of a bark-bark core, (b) a whole bark-bark core at 1.3 m, (c) a cross-sectional disk at 1.3 m and (d) the whole tree, represented by cross-sectional disks at five heights. Site effects and genetic values for families and checks were determined by mixed model analysis. A trend of increasing BD from pith to bark was more pronounced at Albany, where wood formed before age 3.5 years was 12 kg/m3 less dense than at Esperance (P = 0.01) and wood formed from 3.5 to 6.5 years was 27 kg/m3 denser than at Esperance (P < 0.001). Mean whole-tree BD was 19 kg/m3 greater at Albany (P < 0.001). Pilodyn penetration was well-correlated with BD of the 10 mm sample of penetrated wood and this relationship was not greatly affected by site variation. Genetic values for pilodyn penetration formed precise relationships with BD of breast-height discs and whole-tree BD although they were site-specific. Pilodyn penetration was a better predictor for genetic values of whole-tree BD than were bark-bark cores.@@@Eucalyptus globulus

The aims of this study were to investigate techniques for establishing a local native species (Eucalyptus pauciflora) and an exotic species (E. nitens) in the Midlands of Tasmania, a tree-denuded region that has been grazed for over 100 years in Australia. We established trials at the Sorrel Springs and Woodland Park properties. We compared six establishment techniques: control; understorey nurse planting; spot burn; mulch; tree-guard and; self-watering tree-guard. Three months, 1 and 6 years after planting we measured tree height, health index and mortality. At Sorrell Springs tree-guarded treatments had greater height than other treatments at year one, but there were no effects of treatment at year six on height, health or mortality. At Woodland Park mulch, burn and tree-guarded treatments had greater height 1 and 6 years after planting. At year six tree-guarded treatments had lower mortality than other treatments. At Sorrell Springs height of E. nitens was greater than E. pauciflora at year one but not at year six. At Woodland Park height of E. nitens was generally greater at year six but having almost double the incidence of mortality relative to E. pauciflora. We conclude that expensive tree-guarding is only warranted where high browse pressure is expected and that on such sites species with tough leaves that are resistant to browsing should be considered. Further that in environments marginal for growing trees, best practice establishment technique is generally as effective as additional treatments of understorey nurse planting, spot burning or mulching.@@@Regeneration niche

The species is predominantly outcrossing, but with a demonstrated capacity to set selfed seed where outcross pollen is limited, with consequent inbreeding depression in the progeny. Current controlled pollination methods therefore include a time-consuming emasculation step. We used microsatellite genotyping of seedlings to determine the consequences of outcross pollination with and without emasculation. Only 1 of 3 mother trees set a small amount (5%) of selfed seed. Using whole inflorescences from the male parent as the pollen applicator rather than sieved pollen reduced outcross contamination rates from 19.1 to 8.7% and substantially increased worker productivity. Application of sugar solution to the female flowers immediately prior to pollination increased yield of sound seeds per spike. Additional improvements to the pollination protocols are discussed.@@@Tree breeding

Årg using morphological and AFLP markers@@@@@@Received: 29 April 2008 Accepted: 27 May 2010 Published: 11 June 2010 Issue Date: November 2010@@@Domestication of Uapaca kirkiana Müell. Arg is a high priority for improving rural livelihoods of smallholder farmers in southern Africa. Domestication efforts require knowledge of adaptive traits and intra-specific variation. Morphological traits and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers were used to assess genetic variation in twelve provenances of U. kirkiana collected from southern Africa. Assessment of morphological traits showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between provenances. Provenances from Zimbabwe and Zambia showed faster growth than those from Malawi (except Phalombe) and Tanzania. Morphological traits exhibited strong genetic differentiation between provenances and within provenances. The degree of provenance differentiation of traits (Q ST = 0.03–0.139, Q ST mean = 0.092) was in the same range with that of AFLP loci (F ST mean = 0.089) detected among provenances and within provenances (0.002 < F ST < 0.259). The differentiation for some morphological traits could be attributed to local adaptation and human selection of the U. kirkiana trees at the site of origin. Mean Nei’s (H) genetic diversity of AFLP showed high diversity within the provenances (H = 0.181–0.321, H mean = 0.256). An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed higher genetic variation (90.8%) within provenances than among provenances (9.2%). There was no geographical pattern of variation in growth and morphological traits among the seed sources. Chipata provenance from Zambia was the most diverse while Mapanzure from Zimbabwe was the least diverse, though it was superior in height and earliest in fruiting. The pattern of genetic diversity indicates low selection in some areas and high gene flow which would be counteracting it. Therefore regional and country collections and conservation strategies should consider differences by focussing on the main range of the species by paying particular attention to unique populations within countries.@@@AFLP

Here we report the development and application of a set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of L. tulipifera. In total, 176 primer pairs were developed and yielded 132 EST-SSR markers that amplified clear SSR bands with genomic DNA of L. tulipifera. Transferability of these EST-SSR markers to related species and genera was further examined. Twelve highly informative loci screened from 132 EST-SSR markers were applied to explore the effective pollen dispersal patterns and male reproductive success of Liriodendron. A provenance trial population of Liriodendron comprised 12 L. chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg provenances and 5 L. tulipifera provenances. The four maternal trees were randomly sampled as tested maternal trees in the population. Paternities of 220 open-pollination progenies from 4 maternal trees above were potentially identified by means of paternity analysis, of which 138 progenies (accounting for 62.7%) were assigned to 49 male parents at the 95% confidence level. The cumulative exclusion probability of 12 EST-SSR loci was 98.5%. The average effective pollen dispersal distance of pollen donors ranged from 15 to 35 m, with the maximum dispersal distance of 77 m. There were obvious male reproductive success differences among individuals, ranging from 0 to 10.9%. The cumulative male reproductive success of individuals within 35 m radius around the known maternal trees reached 51.4%. Diversiform mating patterns, including selfing, intra-species mating and interspecies mating, coexisted in the occasion of open-pollination in Liriodendron.@@@EST-SSR marker

Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll (TC), total carotenoids, maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v /F m ), photon yield of PSII and non-photochemical quenching, in severely osmotic-stressed plantlets (−1.20 MPa) decreased significantly when compared to control plantlets, leading to low net photosynthetic rate (P n ) and growth reduction. In addition, the photosynthesis and growth parameters of salt stressed plantlets declined to a greater degree than those cultivated in water-deficit conditions. On the other hand, the proline content of the osmotic-stressed leaves increased significantly, especially under iso-osmotic salt stress conditions. The TC content of iso-osmotic stressed leaves was significantly degraded, with low F v /F m , leading to P n reduction and growth inhibition. Those parameters in salt stressed plantlets were significantly lower and to a greater degree than in plantlets subjected to water-deficit. The basic knowledge of biochemical, physiological and morphological changes in responses to iso-osmotic salt and water-deficit stresses will be further applied as effective indices for salt and water-deficit tolerant screening in large population of eucalyptus breeding program.@@@Chlorophyll degradation

At a forest management site in southeast Pará, we censused trees growing scattered across a large open clearing after forest removal and in heavily disturbed forest after selective logging and canopy thinning for survival, stem diameter growth, fruit production, and date of dry season flowering initiation annually during 1997–2003. Trees in the open clearing died at faster rates, grew more slowly, produced fewer fruit, and initiated flowering earlier, on average, than trees in logged and thinned forest during this period. The principal cause of mortality and stem damage in both environments was dry season groundfires. Mahogany trees in logged and thinned forest at the study site grew faster than mahogany trees at a selectively logged but otherwise undisturbed closed-canopy forest site in this region during the same period. This was likely due to vine elimination by groundfires, increased crown exposure after canopy thinning, and soil nutrient inputs due to groundfires. Without effective regulation and control of anthropogenic fires, attempts to manage remnant mahogany trees for future timber yields or to restore commercially viable populations in this region may prove futile.@@@Agricultural-landscape trees

Growth and form traits@@@@@@Received: 26 November 2009 Accepted: 04 May 2010 Published: 16 May 2010 Issue Date: November 2010@@@To investigate genotype by environment interaction (G×E) for clones of radiata pine (Pinus radiata), clonal stability was evaluated for growth and form traits from three trials in New Zealand and three trials in Australia. There were 215–245 clones in common between pairs of New Zealand trials, 17–26 clones in common among Australian trials, while 32–52 clones were in common between New Zealand and Australian sites. Clonal repeatability \( \left( {\hat{H}^{2} } \right) \) and type-B genetic correlations were estimated. The general trend across the six trials for clonal repeatability was that \( \hat{H}^{2} \) was greatest for height (HGT) followed by diameter at breast height (DBH), stem straightness (STR), and branch quality score (BRQ). Within New Zealand trials, there was little evidence of G×E for growth traits, but more for form traits. For DBH the average type-B genetic correlation within New Zealand was 0.82; and for HGT, the average type-B genetic correlation within New Zealand was 0.76. Within Australia, there was only one statistically significant type-B genetic correlation for DBH and this estimate was high indicating that clonal ranks were similar on these two trials. Additionally, within Australia and between regions type-B genetic correlations were generally high for form traits, at least for STR. One Australian trial (Trial 5) showed relatively high clonal stability with the three trials in New Zealand indicating that the ranks of these clones were relatively stable in both regions. From a clonal testing standpoint, these results suggest that stable clones can be identified that perform well in both New Zealand and Australia. Improvements in both growth and form traits can be expected when radiata pine clones are transferred between Australia and New Zealand within regions similar to those sampled in this trial series.@@@Clonal stability

Pine overstorey as well as advance regeneration in subplots were recorded. Analysis of variance and regression analysis showed that in general relative stand basal area (RSBA) was the most important predictor of deciduous advance regeneration density, top height as well as age span of the regeneration layer. In the mountainous zone soil depth (SD) and the presence of mature deciduous trees (MDT) explained a significant amount of the variation in regeneration features. Lower RSBA induced by earlier thinnings resulted in higher regeneration density, larger top heights and wider age span of deciduous species. Under the pine canopy oak regeneration can persist longer compared to natural broadleaved canopies. In the studied plantations pine regeneration was confined to few scattered seedlings and regeneration groups. Based on these findings silvicultural concepts for the further management of black pine plantations in the Middle Balkan Range are discussed.@@@Pinus nigra

Natural and artificial regeneration often cannot compete with fast-growing, shade intolerant species such as yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.). This study examines 5-year survival, growth, and competitive ability of planted northern red oak seedlings in various group selection harvest sizes in south-central Indiana, USA. Seedling stocktypes consisted of high (BHD; 75 seedlings m−2) and low (BLD; 21 seedlings m−2) nursery-bed-density bareroot seedlings, and small (CS; 11.4 L) and large (CL; 18.9 L) container seedlings. Group selection openings included large (0.400 ha), medium (0.100 ha), and small (0.024 ha) circular gaps in four stands. Larger stocktypes and gap sizes improved seedling height, diameter, and growth; ANOVA indicated only gap size was significant for seedling survival. Logistic regression showed survival was positively correlated to diameter at year 1, and aspect, gap size, and stocktype were significant predictors of survival. Our data indicated no differences in density of natural regeneration among gap sizes, although trends suggest greater numbers of bigger competitors in larger gaps sizes. Yellow-poplar regeneration was the tallest competitor of more than 50% of all northern red oak seedlings. Competitive status of seedlings after 5 years differed only by stocktype, with large container stock in a better competitive position than bareroot stock. However, less than 20% of seedlings in all stocktypes in each gap treatment were considered competitive (i.e., ≥80% of the height of tallest competitor) against their tallest competitor. The use of larger planting stock may offer greater opportunities for successfully regenerating northern red oak seedlings on productive sites but likely would have to be accompanied by treatments to reduce woody competition.@@@Group selection harvest

In this paper, six isolates of AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus) were inoculated to Casuarina equisetifolia seedlings under glasshouse conditions to investigate the effects of AMF on growth and drought tolerance of host plants. All the six isolates which belong to Glomus showed high mycorrhizal colonization (88.5–96.0%) with C. equisetifolia seedlings. Seedlings were subjected to drought stress without watering for 7 days and survival of the seedlings inoculated with Glomus caledonium Gc90068, G. versiforme Gv9004 and G. caledonium Gc90036 increased by 36.6, 23.3 and 16.6%, respectively compared with uninoculated seedlings. Limited influence of AMF on seedling height growth was found, but the effects of AMF on total biomass increment were very significant; the increment ranged from 25.7 to 118.9% compared with uninoculated treatment, and it was noted that AMF exerted more influences on root biomass than shoot biomass. Based on the changes in physiological and biochemical parameters among different treatments caused by drought stress, it was concluded that AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) associations improve the drought tolerance of C. equisetifolia seedlings by means of some physiological and biochemical responses, such as lowering permeability of plasma membrane and MDA (malondialdehyde) contents, enhancing concentrations of P nutrition, soluble sugar, soluble protein and activities of POX (Peroxidase) of C. equisetifolia seedlings.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhiza

Experiments were performed in 216 plots (30 × 30 cm), located in three typical stands (Pinus tabulaeformis plantation, Liaodong oak forest and grassland, 72 plots per stand). A seed augmentation experiment was performed in an oak forest and a conifer plantation, and a seed introduction experiment was carried out in a grassland. Three main factors were considered: seed addition, disturbance and shrub cover. The seedling number and growth in every plot were recorded continuously over 3 years. GLM multivariate was used to analyze the relationships between seedling emergence/recruitment and the explanatory variables in every stand. The results showed that seed addition in undisturbed or disturbed plots always caused significantly increased seedling emergence and recruitment in oak and conifer forests. It demonstrated that the recruitment of Liaodong oak was limited by seed and microsite availability under closed forest, and litter is one of the factors leading to microsite limitation. However, in the grassland, no treatments improved recruitment, indicating that the grassland was not suitable for seedling recruitment because of intense light and soil drought. In the conifer forest, more recruited seedlings, and lower herbivory on seedling leaves, as well as thicker stem basal diameters, indicated that the P. tabulaeformis plantation was safer for Liaodong oak seedling establishment. Unexpectedly, shrub cover did not affect the recruitment of Liaodong oak in the three stands.@@@Quercus wutaishanica

Its survival is, however, threatened by bush fire, over-exploitation, grazing and a lack of natural regeneration. The extent of variation in fruit characteristics, seed germination and seedling traits of the baobab tree in Benin, was evaluated at climatic zone level. 1,200 fruits were sampled in each of the three climatic zones of Benin for morphological assessment and to assess germination rate and seedling growth dynamics according to the climatic zones, the used substrate and the scarification of the seed coat. There were significant differences in fruit characteristics not only between climatic zones but also between individuals from the same zone and within-trees. Using mechanical scarification on freshly-collected baobab seeds negatively affected the germination rate of baobab seeds sampled in the Guinean and Sudano-Guinean zones of Benin. The best-germination rate was recorded for non-treated seeds from the Guinean zone, up to 57% on day 25. All seeds germinated best on the sand substrate, but supplying organic matter promoted further seedling growth after 11 days of germination. Based on these observations we propose some strategies for efficient ex situ conservation of baobab in Benin.@@@Climatic zones

Growth data was collected at various intervals up to age 192 months and also data on outer-wood pilodyn penetration (as an indicator of wood density) and acoustic velocity through the outer-wood (as an indicator of modulus of elasticity) at the last assessment. This report examines the results for the main effect of initial stocking treatments and stocking × fertilizer interactions across ages. There were significant differences between initial stockings for both average individual tree volume and standing volume ha−1 at all ages up to 144 months, but just average individual tree volume at 192 months. At ages up to 75 months total standing volume decreased as initial stocking decreased—maximum volume being obtained at 2,222 trees ha−1. From 88 to 110 months the highest standing volume was obtained at 1,667 trees ha−1 and then at ages 144 and 192 months, 833 trees ha−1 provided the highest standing volume. Average individual tree volume at all ages generally increased as initial stocking decreased—the largest trees were obtained at 667 trees ha−1. As age increased the proportional differences between tree volumes at higher and lower stockings increased—at age 27 months average individual tree volume at 667 trees ha−1 was 72% greater than that at 2,222 trees ha−1 and differences increased steadily with age up to 190% at 192 months. There were no significant differences between initial stockings for the properties of the outer-wood assessed by pilodyn penetration and acoustic velocity. Also, no significant interactions were found between initial stocking and fertilizer treatments for any traits at any ages implying that effects of initial stocking and fertilizer are additive for the traits assessed.@@@Eucalypt

Seven provenances were selected which included three from northern Australia and four from Sri Lanka. Twelve Candidate plus trees (CPTs) each were selected from 2 to 3 different locations within each provenance based on the morphometric and qualitative traits (GBH > 100 cm). Seed collection in both hemispheres was carried out from May to August 2008. Calophyllum inophyllum L. provenances showed a distinct hemisphere variation in their seed-related characters and oil content. All provenances differed significantly (P < 0.05) with one another in seed length. Seeds from Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka and seeds from Cardwell Australia recorded the highest (≈57%) and the lowest oil (≈31%) content respectively. Strong correlations were found between seed morphometric characters. Relatively weaker correlations were found between seed morphometric characters and oil content. Variations in seed-related characters were largely attributed by the provenance contribution which shows the significance of the effect of genetic variability on above mentioned seed related characters.@@@Calophyllum inophyllum L.

"519","Impact of soil pressure and compaction on tracheids in Norway spruce seedlings@@@@@@Received: 07 September 2009 Accepted: 21 June 2010 Published: 01 July 2010 Issue Date: January 2011@@@We tested the effect of soil compaction on Norway spruce seedlings in terms of the size and theoretical volume flow rate of the tracheids. The results show that soil pressure limits growth in the diameter of the lumens of tracheids in all parts of seedlings studied. The tracheids of the roots with primary xylem had larger lumens than those of the roots and shoots with secondary xylem in both unloaded and loaded seedlings. This corresponds to the higher cumulative theoretical volume flow rate of the tracheids from roots with primary xylem than those from roots and shoots with secondary xylem. Although the volume flow rate of tracheids, according to the Hagen-Poiseuille law, was directly proportional to the quadratic power of the capillary diameter (tracheid lumen), the cumulative curve of the theoretical hydraulic volume flow rate was higher or relatively comparable in loaded seedlings. An explanation for these findings is that there were higher gradients of water potential values in roots and leaves in loaded seedlings because the lengths of the conductive pathways were 27% shorter than in unloaded seedlings. We hypothesise that trees have adapted to different stresses by shortening their conductive pathways to maintain a transpiration rate similar to that of non-stressed trees. These results concerning the impact of soil compaction on tracheid diameter and volume flow rate improve our understanding of the growth and functioning of different conifer organs and the mechanisms underlying the efficiency of water transport through the root xylem to the shoot.@@@Adaptation

Accelerated aging seeds treated for 0–14 days exhibited loss of germinability in the longest aging treated seeds (11%, 14 days) compared to a good performance of 52% for control (0 day) seeds. Leachate electrical conductivity (EC) increase had strong negative correlation with seed vigor (−0.9). Magnesium ion concentration in electrolyte leakage from artificial aged seeds showed positive correlation (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). The ratios of inorganic ions showed that K+/Mg2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, and Na+/Mg2+ were inversely correlated with germination (−0.93, −0.82, and −0.91, respectively). Increases in starch and total soluble sugar content in aged seeds were associated with a decrease in seed vigor. In conclusion, EC, magnesium ion concentration, K+/Mg2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, and Na+/Mg2+ ratios and starch and total soluble sugar content could provide a sensitive and accurate index for the assessment of U. parvifolia seed vigor.@@@Seed storage

In central Louisiana, USA, two fertilization levels—No (NF) or Yes (F-36 kg/ha N and 40 kg/ha P) in combination with three vegetation treatments—Check, four prescribed fires (PF), or multi-year vegetation control by herbicidal and mechanical means (IVM) were applied to container-grown longleaf pine plantings in a grass savanna. After 10 years, P concentration in longleaf pine foliage was less on NF plots than F plots, but fertilization did not significantly affect tree stature. Survival was greater on NF plots than F plots, and so, NF plots were more productive (NF—63 m3/ha and F—45 m3/ha). Pine trees on IVM plots (37 dm3/tree) were significantly larger than on Check and PF plots, which averaged 17 dm3/tree. Survival was better on IVM plots (88%) than PF plots (78%), which was better than Checks (58%). Consequently, IVM plots were most productive (99 m3/ha), followed by PF plots (44 m3/ha), and lastly Checks (28 m3/ha). PF plots had greater grass cover (38%) than Check and IVM plots, which averaged 5%, whereas PF and IVM plots had less understory arborescent cover (an average of 25%) than Checks (91%). A wildfire in March 2007 reduced pine survival by 22, 14, and 1 percentage points on IVM, Check, and PF plots, respectively. Seven months later, longleaf pine production had decreased to 92 m3/ha on IVM plots while increasing to 55 m3/ha on PF plots and 30 m3/ha on Checks. Overall, the wildfire rejuvenated the herbaceous plant community. Grass cover on Check and IVM plots averaged 20% while grass cover on PF plots was 36%. Forb cover increased on all treatments from 2% before the wildfire to 13% seven months after the wildfire. Understory arborescent cover decreased on Checks to 62% but increased slightly on PF and IVM plots and averaged 30%.@@@Arson

"522","A stand dynamic model for red pine plantations with different initial densities@@@@@@Received: 16 May 2008 Accepted: 08 June 2010 Published: 20 June 2010 Issue Date: January 2011@@@A stand dynamic model was developed to predict the growth response in even-aged forest plantations of different initial planting densities. The model is based on the integration of three subcomponents: height growth, self-thinning, and diameter increment. The integrated model uses the height of dominant trees to simulate stand response to site quality and internal growth potential. An extended self-thinning submodel is used to simulate mortality in stands due to crowding and inter-tree competition. A diameter increment submodel is used to link the height growth and self-thinning submodels. The height growth submodel is based on an application of the “Pipe Model” theory. The three-parameter self-thinning submodel is developed from an extended self-thinning law that captures self-thinning in stands before they attain full stocking. The diameter increment model is based on the assumption that diameter increment is related to height growth and available growing space described by stand density. The integrated model is applied to data collected from a 45-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation subsectioned with different initial planting densities. For the data used, only two parameters were required to capture 99% of measured variation in height growth. Additional data from sites with different planting intensities are required to formulate a more generalized height growth model. The slope of the linear self-thinning limit for red pine is approximately −1.5. Model predictions are consistent with field measurements.@@@Density index

An economic estimation@@@@@@Received: 07 January 2010 Accepted: 02 June 2010 Published: 12 June 2010 Issue Date: January 2011@@@Panama has the highest rate of change in the area of primary forests within Central America. However, to meet growing timber demands, it became popular over the last decades to establish plantations made up of foreign species such as Tectona grandis or Pinus spp. In the majority of the cases the species used are well known; their characteristics such as growth performance have been reviewed intensively and can be accessed in numerous publications. Characteristics of Panama’s native tree species of commercial relevance such as Hieronyma alchorneoides, Swietenia macrophylla and Terminalia amazonia are largely unknown and have been investigated within the study at hand. Using valuation methods of financial mathematics, the competitive position of these three indigenous species was assessed, the results compared to those of T. grandis stands in the same area. Land costs and taxes were not considered, as they would be the same for all species. Financial estimates for indigenous species will enlarge their acceptance for use in reforestation and plantation projects. Using the NPV method and applying the standard scenario, the profitability of T. grandis is lower than that of T. amazonia and S. macrophylla and lies only slightly above the profitability calculated for H. alchorneoides. This result clearly indicates that the investigated native tree species are comparable with T. grandis regarding their economic profitability. Besides its ecological impact, growing native tree species is now also economically legitimate. By calculating land expectation values for all tree species, ideal rotation lengths could be determined. For these species, considerable flexibility exists regarding the optimal rotation length.@@@Reforestation

The damage and growth were compared at these sites in stands with three SSD’s and different light regimes: uncut forest (SSD 500, ~500 stems/ha), shelterwood (SSD 150,~150 stems/ha), and clear-cut (SSD, 0 stems). Half of the seedlings were irrigated with fertiliser (10 mM N). Fertilisation and SSD affected the height growth of P. abies, since fertilised seedlings in SSD 0 grew the most (22.2 cm). Fertilised seedlings in SSD 0 also generally had the greatest biomass (twigs, leading shoot and needles), even P. sylvestris seedlings on the North slope, where fertilised and unfertilised pine seedlings in SSD 0 had 62.6 and 39.7 g biomass, respectively. P. sylvestris increased about 150% in dry mass of leading shoot of the increase of P. abies with equal height growth, when comparing SSD 150 and SSD 0. The results indicate that the general conditions of the stand have stronger effects on the growth of planted seedlings than their orientation and distance with respect to the nearest tree and that light requirements cannot be moderated by fertilisation. We postulate that a system in which forest gaps are formed under a shelterwood could provide a way to regenerate forests that exploits the beneficial features of both shelter trees and clear-cuts.@@@Biomass

Another five temporary plots were used for stem census in surrounding old-growth forest for comparison. In the first year after land abandonment, seedling stem density (H < 2 m) was 65,800/ha, increasing to 161,200/ha by third year, then sharply decreasing to 2,500/ha in 21–30 year-old forests. The sapling stratum (H ≥ 2 m and DBH < 5 cm) started to be recruited in the fifth year, increasing to reach a peak density of 4,530 stems/ha at year ten, then decreased to 580 stems/ha at year 21–30. The tree stratum (DBH ≥ 5 cm) achieved the maximum density of 600 stems/ha at year ten. Meanwhile, the density of all strata in the old-growth forest was 2,980 stems/ha. Sprouts played an important role, accounting for 34% at the first year then increased gradually to 73% at year 21–30. Total basal area attained a peak at 5.43 m2/ha at year ten; it was 4.9 m2/ha in the old-growth forest. These four species played an important role in providing ecological services for recruitment of other species during the first 10 years of fallow stand development, which increased to 35 species in 21–30 year-old secondary forest.@@@Basal area

Nine black walnut female genitors were selected to represent a range of phenotypes. Seeds were collected, cleaned, cold-treated, and pre-sprouted to ensure that germination was uniform and complete. The pre-sprouted seeds were planted in a randomized complete block design into standard nursery beds in Indiana, USA at three sowing densities, (11.2 plants m−2; 24.2 plants m−2; 29.4 plants m−2). After lifting, the trees were measured for height, ground-line diameter and root volume and then planted into a plantation in a randomized complete block design and re-measured after 1 and 5 years of growth. One year after planting, the effects of family (half-sib seed source) and density were significant or very highly significant for seedling height, and ground-line diameter, although family effects were greater than those for density, especially at moderate and high nursery bed density. After 5 years of growth, the same effects contributed significantly to ground-line diameter and dbh, but only family significantly influenced height. Family was more important than nursery bed density in determining the size of the trees after 5 years. Although there were no significant family × density interactions after 5 years, family variance for all the traits was considerably higher among seedlings grown at moderate and high density in the nursery. Phenotypic correlations among traits within and among years were generally very high (0.65 < r < 0.90) and insensitive to planting density in the nursery.@@@Seedling quality

The shade frames allowed 50–60% light transmission, with limited effects on air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, and soil moisture around seedlings. Based on fluorescence yield and chlorophyll content measurements, summer-only shade reduced photoinhibition and photooxidation, especially in summer and fall; extending to all year shading did not further reduce either photoinhibition or photooxidation. Shade tended to reduce seedling diameter and mortality, but after 2 years the cumulative effect on mortality was not statistically significant. Study results support the establishment of white spruce seedlings under partial forest canopy, especially on sites with harsh environmental conditions.@@@Photoinhibition

Acacia ampliceps is a highly salt-tolerant small tree, naturally-occurring in north-western Australia, which produces abundant biomass with potential for fuelwood and fodder. We investigated the extent of variation amongst provenances and families of A. ampliceps for seedling response to salt and waterlogging. Seven-week old seedlings from 27 families (seven provenances, grouped into two regions), were treated in sand-filled pots in a glasshouse with either mixed salt (S) solutions (150 mol m−3 for 14 days, 300 mol m−3 for 33 days), waterlogging (W) or combined salt (S) and waterlogging (SW). Only 3% of seedlings died, mostly from the combined salt × waterlogging treatment. Seedlings from the Kimberley region had significantly greater height and shoot biomass than those from the Pilbara. Within these regions, Wave Hill (seedlot 14631) and Halls Creek (15738) provenances had the best growth. Height growth was reduced similarly for S- and W-treated plants, whereas that of SW-treated plants was reduced much more. Salt and waterlogging caused shoot dry weight reduction at harvest of 41 and 46%, respectively, with a slight interaction between salt and waterlogging; SW treated plants were most affected. Generally there were relatively small differences in the growth response of provenances and families to salt, but larger (often highly significant) variation in response to waterlogging. Genotypic variation for shoot and phyllode water content and phyllode number in response to salt and waterlogging was generally small. The good agreement found at the provenance level between seedling growth in this experiment and growth of young trees on saline land in a trial in Pakistan suggests that glasshouse screening may be a useful means for selecting potential provenances for field evaluation.@@@Acacia ampliceps

We hypothesized that these inocula have the potential to contribute to the establishment of naturally disseminated seedlings. Also, we determined the main fungal taxa involved in this process. Seven plantations in the onset of their reproductive phase and located in the Patagonian native forest/steppe ecotone (Argentina) were selected. Soil samplings were obtained at nine points along a 450 m long, W-E transect established in each plantation. Soil bioassays were performed in a greenhouse, with P. ponderosa seedlings acting as hosts for mycorrhizal inocula present in soil samples, during 12 months. Mycorrhization percentage, morphotype richness and morphotype composition was determined through morphological evaluation. Viable ecto- and ectendomycorrhizal inocula were found disseminated outside plantations. The amount of mycorrhizal inoculum followed a decreasing function with distance to plantation edges. Mycorrhizal fungal genus Rhizopogon and “E-strain” mycorrhizal types appeared as pioneering taxa regarding seedlings colonization, being the most persistent and frequent symbionts found. Plantations, thus, facilitate the surrounding terrain for newcoming seedlings through the dispersion of mycorrhizal fungal inocula.@@@Ponderosa pine

In Malaysia, rubberwood has grown from 26% of total exported wood products in 1998 to 35% in 2007. A high proportion of furniture products (80%) is rubberwood, whereas the contribution of rubberwood to other wooden products is less than 20%. Only 10% of sawn timber and logs is rubberwood. In Thailand, rubberwood contributes to around 60% of total exported wood products, arising from a high share of not only furniture products (70%) but also other wood products (around 50%) and sawn timber and logs, which have increased in share from 40% in 1998 to 79% in 2007. We conclude that the high proportion of rubberwood products in the wood export markets of these two countries is a result of: (1) scarcity of raw wood materials because of strict controls on the logging of natural forests; and (2) governmental support to rubberwood production, including financial support to rubber planters and technical assistance to downstream timber processors.@@@Forest plantation

We conducted a two-year study to assess the aboveground interactions between Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir (Abies grandis) and noble fir (Abies procera) seedlings planted in closely spaced (stems 10 cm apart) conspecific and heterospecific pairs. Paired seedling growth also was compared to seedlings planted with no neighbor. Stem height growth was not affected by the presence of a neighbor seedling, although diameter growth was slightly reduced. Branch diameter growth and weight were reduced where seedling crowns overlapped; branch morphological data suggested that this was caused by shading rather than mechanical interactions. Light measurements showed the potential for significant shading, particularly by the relatively large, dense crowns of Douglas-fir. Heterospecific pairs including Douglas-fir demonstrated the competitive production principle in that their mean growth was greater than the average of conspecific pairs of both species. Neighbor seedling height significantly affected subject seedling growth; neighbor effects were similar whether the neighbor seedling was growing on the north or south side of the subject seedling. Light reflected from Douglas-fir crowns had a lower red: far-red ratio than that of noble fir, although there was no evidence of a phytochrome-mediated growth response to the neighbor seedling. While heterospecific seedling pairs showed reduced competition, we found no evidence of facilitation for seedlings growing in very close proximity.@@@Seedling

We hypothesized that application of organic mulch would improve soil nitrogen availability and increase tree growth, while the quality of mulching materials would alter the supply of essential nutrients. In this study, poplar plantations were established in 2004 and two experiments were established in the field. The fresh above-ground biomass of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica (L.) P. Beauv.), oak (Quercus fabri Hance), Chinese coriaria (Coriaria nepalensis Wallich) and brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn. var. latiusculum (Desv.) Underw. ex Heller) in the current year was selected as mulching materials, and mulches were annually applied at the rate of 5.0 kg/m2 in the N mineralization experiment and 20,000 kg/ha in growth and nutrient availability experiment. Additions of fresh biomass significantly improved annual net N-mineralization estimates and the mulching treatments increased the cumulative N mineralized over the incubation period by 22–30%. However, a significant difference in the cumulative N mineralized was not observed among the mulched treatments, even if the cumulative N mineralized in the treatment mulched with oak (QF) was 5.9, 3.3 and 2.2% greater than that of treatments with brackenfern (PA), Chinese coriaria (CN) and cogongrass (IC), respectively. Application of fresh biomass mulch markedly affected soil available N contents and growth performance of poplar plantations. The mulching treatments with QF, IC, PA and CN increased annual means of available N concentration by 39.0, 29.0, 29.6 and 39.7% respectively. At the end of the fifth growing season, the average height of poplar plantations in treatments mulched with QF, IC, PA and CN was 46.8, 14.9, 42.6 and 57.4% greater than that in Check (CK-no mulch), while mean DBH increased by 35.4, 12.5, 33.3 and 52.1%, respectively. Overall, the productivity was enhanced in mulched plots at the end of the third growing season. Compared with CK, the treatments mulched with QF, IC, PA and CN increased total biomass by 97.4, 96.4, 63.1 and 81.6%, respectively. Based on the results of this study, annual application of 20,000 kg/ha fresh woody biomass would be recommended for soil improvement in young poplar plantations growing on a degraded agricultural soil.@@@Available N concentration

The information about maturity time of fruit/seed is scanty and studies on seed germination enhancement lacking. In the present study, the main focus has been given to the physical fruits/seeds attributes which are reliable indicators of maturity and seed pretreatments which help to enhance germination. The fruits/seeds were collected from low and high elevational sites covering the altitudinal range of the species during the period of fruit/seed development (last week of February–mid April) for two consecutive years (2003–2004). The change in fruit colour from dark green to pale red or red was a useful indicator of seed maturity in P. cerasoides. Fruit moisture content between 46.57 ± 0.45% and 56.81 ± 1.14% and seed moisture content between 29.8 ± 1.35% and 34.13 ± 1.50% coincided with maximum germination (41.11 ± 13.96% and 59.99 ± 12.05%) across sites. The removal of seed coat (mechanical treatment) enhanced the germination of seeds to 70 ± 0% at low elevation and 100 ± 0% at high elevation in comparison of control or untreated seeds (germination range between 5.83 ± 0.83% and 31.68 ± 25.02%).

Chev, is an indigenous fruit tree species that could be used in agroforestry systems with both environmental and economic benefits. The seed oil is of prime importance as a foreign exchange earner and is being developed as a rural based enterprise in many African countries notably Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tanzania. Methods for propagation and conservation of the species are therefore of prime importance. The seeds of the species are however difficult to germinate hindering its domestication process. Allanblackia parviflora seeds were collected from seven different populations in Ghana and were subjected to four different seed germination trials at the nursery of CSIR-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana at Fumesua, Kumasi. This was followed by studying the effect of stage of seed germination on establishment after potting. Intact seeds began germination at 7 months after sowing and at 24 months, significant (P < 0.001) variations were observed in the seed germination ability of 74 accessions. Mean seed germination ranged from 0 to 35%. Significant differences in seed germination percentages among populations (P < 0.001) and provenances (P < 0.05) were also observed. Removal of seed coat significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced seed germination. Germination percentages of seeds with seed coat removed ranged from 6 to 43% while seed germination percentages for intact seeds were less or equal to 3%. Incubation of seeds with seed coat removed in polythene bags gave an added advantage. Seeds with seed coat removed and kept in polythene bags started germinating from 2 weeks and within 10 months, 75 and 68% germination were obtained for plane and black polythene bags, respectively. Removal of germinants and potting when shoot length was at least 1 cm gave significantly higher growth (P < 0.001 for shoot height, P < 0.05 for stem diameter, P < 0.001 for number of leaves produced) compared to when only radicle had emerged. It became evident in this study that seeds should be classified as fully germinated only when shoots begin to grow.@@@Allanblackia parviflora

"537","A research approach supporting domestication of Baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in West Africa@@@@@@Received: 21 August 2009 Accepted: 10 January 2011 Published: 25 January 2011 Issue Date: May 2011@@@The Baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) is a key multipurpose species for the African region. In the recent years there has been an extended commercial interest for different A. digitata products. As a spectacular African key species there has been a growing interest from NGO′s and various research groups. A research group, focussing on the following countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, has participated in a concerted research action with cross counter disciplinary cooperation between plant physiology, population genetics, tree breeding, food science, and socioeconomics. This paper presents a review and the way knowledge gaps are being addressed using the above mentioned approach. The overall work was initiated in 2005–2006 when a large collection of A. digitata seeds was carried out in 15 African countries. Fourteen populations were selected in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger including more than 400 superior trees, and many of the trees have been selected along with farmers in a participatory process. Studies have been initiated in all countries on geographic variation of growth, adaptive and phenological traits. This includes studies in the nursery, establishment of international provenance series, seed orchards and studies of gene flow and phylogeographic variation with various markers. Specific nursery trials have been established in order to study provenance and progeny performance related to drought stress. Several stress related characteristics are being measured. Preliminary observations showed large morphological variation between African provenances of A. digitata. Food properties of plant parts have been studied within and between populations. This includes studies of total biomass production, vitamin A, B1, B2, and various minerals. The influence of stress will be related to these parameters. Fruits, which are rich in sugar and vitamin C, are used as an ingredient in juice and other foods. Seeds can be used directly as food ingredient or in fermented condition (Maari). The fermentation process was previously poorly described. Therefore, the microorganisms associated with Baobab seeds fermentation have been identified and a starter cultures for control production has been proposed. The efficiency of dissemination of superior A. digitata trees depends on vegetative propagation. Various grafting methods are currently being tested in cooperation with farmers. Micropropagation is tested as well as a method for clone propagation. The accumulated knowledge will be applied for a domestication strategy of A. digitata in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The outcome from this study will be guidelines for protection and management of the germplasm of A. digitata resources.@@@Food security

Research on the domestication of local fruit trees has started recently through projects concentrating on some of the most important indigenous species of dry West Africa, i.e. Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa, Tamarindus indica, Vitellaria paradoxa and Ziziphus mauritiana. We present a status of finalised and ongoing domestication research with the aim of defining research gaps that would need to be covered by future research activities to obtain higher yields and better quality fruits. Germplasm collection in central West Africa has been intense compared to elsewhere in the species’ distribution areas, but conservation status of the material is poor since it is only planted in few trials. Knowledge of genetic parameters, especially for fruit traits, is almost absent, but characterisation of genotypes is underway for some of the species. Mating systems and patterns are still unknown for many species. Efficient vegetative propagation based on simple techniques was shown to be possible for all species except P. biglobosa. In order to secure immediate as well as long term gains, we recommend combining clonal propagation of selected plus individuals with recombination and breeding of selected genotypes. We discuss whether local institutions in the Sahel have the financial capacity to carry out long term breeding programmes, and suggest that efforts should be made to find new ways of disseminating improved germplasm.@@@Adansonia digitata

Due to its high economic relevance, there is considerable interest in developing techniques for vegetative breeding aimed at mass propagation. In this study we present a mini-propagation protocol in order to define an efficient method to propagate families or clones of P. pinaster. We carried out three experiments using mini-cuttings of 3–5 cm in length with the aim of evaluating the effects of temperature (4°C vs. 25°C), plant growth regulator (IBA) and shoot age on rooting ability. Percentage of rooted cuttings and morphological root variables were recorded. The percentage of rooted cuttings per treatment ranged from 68 to 97%. Treatment with IBA significantly influenced the rooting process at 25°C but not at 4°C. The number of apexes, length, area and volume of roots were all positively affected by temperature treatment. Shoot age also had a positive effect on rooting capacity of cuttings, with the cuttings from the youngest shoots (70 days after pruning) having higher rooting percentages, ranging from 84.7 to 98.3%. The use of juvenile material, good environmental conditions and IBA all benefited the rooting of clonal material, resulting in high rooting capacity. This study presents an innovative propagation protocol for P. pinaster that can be used as a tool in breeding programs.@@@Maritime pine

Allanblackia seeds contain a hard white fat consisting mostly of stearic (52–58%) and oleic (39–49%) acids. This unusual fatty acid content has the right properties for many different food and cosmetic products making them commercially interesting. Vegetative propagation studies on A. floribunda, which grows naturally in the moist forest of Cameroon and Nigeria, were initiated aimed at evaluating its amenability to grafting. Scions were grafted onto 18 month old rootstocks of A. floribunda using side tongue, top cleft, side veneer, whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions in Cameroon. In parallel, side tongue and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side tongue new grafts with non perforated translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. Under nursery conditions, side tongue grafts were significantly more successful (80.0 ± 6.3%), than grafts of side veneer (52.5 ± 7.9%), top cleft (55.0 ± 7.9%) and whip and tongue (50.0 ± 7.9%). The success of side tongue graft was further increased (86.7 ± 6.2%) under the shade of evergreen trees when protected by non perforated translucent plastic. These results indicate the potential for in situ grafting and ‘top working’ to promote cultivation of more productive germplasm of Allanblackia within multifunctional agricultural systems.@@@Allanblackia

In this study, we identified 2300 putative introns and successfully designed primers for them in loblolly pine by comparing the cDNAs of loblolly pine with the homologous genes of Arabidopsis and rice, and experimentally examined 400 of them using 9 conifer species of two families (7 of Pinaceae and 2 of Cupressaceae) as materials. We found that about 88% of the predicted introns appeared to be correct, suggesting that the exon–intron structures are highly conservative in plants, even between Magnoliophyta and Coniferophyta. Therefore, prediction of introns in the species of Coniferophyta by referring to the model species of Magnoliophyta is feasible. Based on 39 ILP markers, a reasonable dendrogram of the 9 conifer species was constructed, demonstrating that ILP markers are quite suitable for phylogenetic studies involving distant species or higher taxonomic ranks.@@@Pinaceae

A greenhouse experiment tested the hypothesis that a new planting method, planting cuttings horizontally, exhibited more biomass production and more effective filter than did planting cuttings vertically. Due to the different times taken for shoots break through the soil surface, the summed height of all shoots of horizontally planted cuttings was significantly smaller than that of the vertical ones at the beginning of the growth period. The difference in the height of all of the shoots between planting orientations decreased with time. After 16 weeks growth, the biomass of the stem, leaves and fine roots was not affected by the planting orientation. The coarse root biomass was larger in the horizontal treatments and decreased with increased density. The total biomass, as well as the biomass of stem or leaves, of each treatment, increased with increased planting density. The individual plant biomass, as well as that of the stem or leaves, decreased with increased planting density. Compared with the unplanted control treatment, the planted treatments significantly reduced the total-N, NO3-N, PO4-P and SO4-S leaching. The planting orientation did not affect the nitrate leaching. The horizontally planted cuttings were slightly more effective for reducing the SO4-S leaching and the vertically planted cuttings were slightly more effective for reducing the PO4-P leaching. Lower PO4-P leaching was observed only with higher planting density. With regard to the horizontal planting method, further studies are needed to explore the influence of different willow clones, the size of cuttings, pre-planting treatments, planting geometry (configuration) and soil conditions on survival, the number of shoots produced, the biomass production and the amount and distribution of roots.@@@Horizontal orientation

However, clonal propagation is limited by declines in adventitious root formation with increasing stock plant age. We examined the effects of immediate or delayed IBA application on adventitious root formation and subsequent root and shoot development of cuttings harvested from 8-year-old clonal hedge plants of Pinus elliottii var. elliottii × P. caribaea var. hondurensis. IBA applied at the time of setting accelerated root formation, elevating the percentage of cuttings with roots at 13 weeks post-setting from 45 to 78% and from 83 to 93% for a low- and a high-rooting clone, respectively. Final rooting percentages for the same treatments and clones (78 and 85%, and 88 and 100%, respectively, at 20 weeks post-setting) were not significantly affected by IBA application. IBA increased the root:shoot ratio of rooted cuttings by decreasing shoot weight compared with untreated cuttings, without affecting root weight, root length, root surface area or root volume. IBA was only effective when applied at the time of setting. A simple IBA treatment for cuttings from 8-year-old clonal hedges, by accelerating root production, has potential for reducing nursery costs and increasing the root system quality of containerised pine cuttings.@@@Auxin

Therefore, there is a need to undertake restoration actions for both production and environmental services. To do so, there is a need to identify factors that are affecting the dynamics of parkland systems. The present study aimed at characterizing and quantifying tree diversity of parkland systems taking into consideration the household’s wealth status, land uses, market access and the type of farming system (cereal based on the “Plateau Central” and cotton based in “Boucle du Mouhoun”). Six villages (Kienfangué, Ipelcé, and Kuizili with easy access to the market and, Karang-Tanghin, Nionsna and Targho with poor access to the market) in the “Plateau Central” and six villages (Bondoukuy, Ouahabou and Yaho with easy access to the market and, Dora, Fakéna and Mamou with poor access to the market) in “Boucle du Mouhoun” were studied. In each village, the Participatory Analysis of Poverty and Livelihood Dynamics method was used by rural farmers to rank farmer households of their communities and that gave three groups of wealth status that are poor, fairly well-off and well-off. Five households representing each of the three wealth groups in each village, giving a total of 15 households per village, were randomly selected by wealth group. Tree/shrub inventories were conducted in all land use types (house fields, village fields and bush fields) of the 180 selected households for the 12 studied sites. The number of species in the different land use types ranged from 96 to 102, but the majority of species were represented by less than 10 individuals. This indicates the selection effect made by the farmers to the parklands. Land use and farming system showed a clear effect on tree diversity in parklands. The effect of accessibility to market was evident in some cases whereas wealth status did not show any effect. Despite the statistical significant effect of farming system and land use type, the ANOVA models accounted for relatively little variation, indicating that other factors may contribute to tree diversity in parkland systems. The most threatened species were Adansonia digitata, Afzelia africana, Bombax costatum, Celtis integrifolia, Ficus asperifolia, Ficus iteophylla, Lannea velutina, and Parkia biglobosa. These species were represented in the largest diameter class (≥80 cm) or showed very few individuals in the different diameter classes. Due to the increasing degradation of the parklands, a domestication and conservation strategy of key threatened species needs to be developed and implemented with the participation of local communities.@@@Agroforestry parklands

This range in times and temperatures allows the first concurrent observation of and differentiation between surface and bulk behavior in the 20nm region nearest the free surface of the polymer film. Of particular importance is the temperature region near the bulk glass transition temperature where both surface and bulk processes can be measured. The results indicate that for the case of PS, enhanced surface mobility only exists at temperatures near or below the bulk T g value. The surface relaxation times are only weakly temperature dependent and near T g , the enhanced mobility extends less than 10nm into the bulk of the film. The results suggest that both the concept of a “surface glass transition” and the use of glass transition temperatures to measure local mobility near interfaces may not universally apply to all polymers. The results can also be used to make a quantitative connection to molecular dynamics simulations of polymer films and surfaces.@@@Glassy Polymer

This effective 4D metric is the induced metric on a 4D hypersurface, here representing our universe, which is obtained from a 5D Ricci-flat SdS static metric, after implementing a planar coordinate transformation. On this background, we found that at the end of the inflation, the squared fluctuations of the inflaton field are not exactly scale independent and result sensitive to the mass of the BH.@@@Black Hole

We assessed effects of the plant growth regulators, benzyladenine, kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid and gibberellic acid, on shoot proliferation and subsequent plantlet conversion. Shoot proliferation over four passages was higher in media containing benzyladenine than in media containing other growth regulators, and optimal proliferation from seed of three different sources was consistently obtained in medium containing 4.4 μM benzyladenine. Shoots from this medium were converted to plantlets at high frequencies (76–90%) after treatment with 19.6 μM indole-3-butyric acid, and almost all plantlets were successfully acclimatized to nursery conditions. These methods provide the means for establishing in vitro and ex vitro clone banks of juvenile K. senegalensis trees for field selection of desired genotypes and tropical plantation establishment.@@@Khaya

The environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges (low = 1,000–1,400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1,400–1,800 masl, and high = 1,800–2,200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of 27 plots. We calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges, employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types.@@@Understory

Correa which is of considerable socio-economic importance and possess morphogenetic variation and qualities of wider adaptability to different soils. Cytology, phenology, pollination, breeding system and natural regeneration of wild and cultivated trees from India revealed the existence of diploid (2n = 18) and tetraploid trees (2n = 36) in Pachmarhi hills and only diploid trees in Punjab plains and Shiwalik hills. The diploid and tetraploid trees showed normal meiosis and high pollen fertility. Phenological events which included leaf fall, leaf emergence, floral bud break, flowering and fruiting are nearly the same in wild and cultivated trees. Natural pollen transfer in the species was highly efficient. Levels of fruit set following open pollination was quite high and is reduced considerably following hand pollination probably due to some injury caused to stigma during experiments. Inspite of synchronous nature of anther dehiscence and stigmatic receptivity, selfing in a flower was avoided due to herkogamy. Some selfing, however, occurred through geitonogamous mode as bagging of panicles yielded 12.21 ± 0.99 to 14.12 ± 0.91% fruit set. High pollen ovule ratio (9,250–10,600) indicated toward the obligate outbreeding nature. The species suited to insect and wind mode of pollination. High amount of air borne pollen grains deposited on glycerine smeared glass microscopic slides suggested towards the wind mode of pollination. Though flowers are dull coloured a variety of insects visited the flowers due to sweet fragrance and stamen/pollen as food reward. Among insect pollinators, honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the major and legitimate pollinator while the rest were either minor pollinators or mere visitors. Inspite of high fruit/seed set, natural regeneration through seeds was poor as fallen fruits were destroyed by fungal pathogens and white ants. The species also propagated vegetatively through coppices and root suckers. It lacks agamospermy as bagging of emasculated flowers yielded no fruit. It is inferred that ‘bael’ which lacks agamospermy reproduced successfully through gamospermy (xenogamy and geitonogamy) and vegetative mode (coppices and root suckers). We also concluded that tetraploid trees growing in the Pachmarhi hills with large sized fruits possessed better potentialities in horticulture if planted through root suckers or coppices.@@@Aegle marmelos

Local availability and conversion into secondary energy carriers with a lower capital investment shows more weights on its interests. The substitution of fossil fuel by biomass fuel can have a strong effect on the mitigation of climate change through reducing greenhouse gases, which can be an important consideration for CDM projects in Bangladesh. This study uses literature review to analyse the legal framework of carbon trading under CDM, CDM additionality, CDM and bioenergy promotion, land availability and technology for biomass production, and sustainability of CDM projects in Bangladesh. The barriers to CDM projects in Bangladesh are explained as well as measures for promoting biomass production. Biomass and bioenergy-based CDM projects can be attractive and support sustainable development in Bangladesh.

Trees were planted at a spacing of 3 × 2 m and evaluated at three locations. Height growth was significantly higher in leucaena during the 4 year where as difference in diameter growth was not significant. Biomass partitioning to the bole was high in case of leucaena, ranged from 83% in 2.5–5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) trees to 89% in 12.5–15 cm DBH trees and in eucalyptus clones the corresponding values were 71% in 2.5–5 cm DBH trees and 83% in 12.5–15 cm DBH trees. Marketable biomass productivity was higher with leucaena (95 Mg ha−1) in comparison to eucalyptus (87 Mg ha−1). Competition effects of trees on intercrops were observed from the 2 year (2002 post-rainy season). Intercrop yields were 45% of the sole crop in eucalyptus system and 36% in leucaena system during the 2 year. Sole eucalyptus and leucaena plantations and intercropping systems recorded higher gross and net returns over arable cropping. Therefore, it can be concluded that leucaena variety K636 and eucalyptus clonal based agroforestry systems are profitable alternatives to arable cropping under rainfed conditions.@@@Agroforestry

Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences in growth traits and wood properties between clones and sites, and that the clone × site interactions were also significant except for basic density. Coefficients of variation ranged from 8.4 to 27.9% for growth traits, 2.7–11.1% for wood properties and 14.0–23.3% for bark percentage. Repeatability ranged from 0.73 to 0.96 for growth traits, 0.32–0.93 for wood properties and 0.77–0.88 for bark percentage. Strong genotypic correlations between the same traits in clones at pairs of sites indicated that the traits were rather stable across sites. The genotypic correlations between growth traits and basic density ranged from −0.67 to 0.43, and generally favorable negative genotypic correlations between growth traits and bark percentage were also found. The correlations between growth traits and Pilodyn pin penetration were positive, ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and therefore unfavorable as lower wood density will be associated with higher values of Pilodyn pin penetration and improved growth rate. The correlations between traits assessed using non-destructive field methods and wood property assessment results indicated that Pilodyn and Fakopp microsecond timer tools can be confidently used to indirectly select for fiber width and basic density.@@@Genotypic variation

Because of its low cost and time-saving advantages, direct seeding has been considered a useful method in forest regeneration. To improve our understanding of whether and how direct seeding can lead to the establishment of indigenous tree species, we carried out an experiment in four typical plantations (eucalyptus, mixed-native, mixed-legume, mixed-conifer) and a shrubland in South China. We also tested the effect of understory vegetation and litter removal on seedling establishment and growth. Seeds of three indigenous tree species (Castanopsis chinensis, Cryptocarya chinensis, and Psychotria rubra) were sown with understory vegetation and litter either retained or removed. Seedling emergence, survival, and growth were recorded for 21 months. We found that conditions that favored seedling emergence often differed from those that favored seedling survival. While the removal of understory vegetation and litter did not influence the final seedling establishments for all the three introduced species, growth of Psychotria rubra was influenced at several sites. Seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence and subsequent growth. The large-seeded Castanopsis chinensis showed higher emergence and growth than the intermediate-seeded Cryptocarya chinensis or the small-seeded Psychotria rubra. Seedlings of Castanopsis chinensis grew better in plant communities with high understory light penetration and high soil exchangeable potassium. Growth of P. rubra seedlings decreased significantly with soil hydrolyzed nitrogen. In conclusion, direct seeding can be useful for the establishment of indigenous tree species into plantations and shrubland. Optimizing early seedling establishment and growth will require the selection of suitable native species for improving seedling establishment in different plantations. Additionally, understory vegetation and litter and fertilizer should be properly managed to enhance the establishment of certain indigenous tree species.@@@Colonization

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of covering different fractions (0, 30, 70 and 100%) of the wetted area surrounding seedlings of Acacia saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. with a black polyethylene sheet on the seedlings development and water use. The cover treatments were applied to plots with and without Acacia seedlings. Within the mulched areas at all depths, soil temperatures close to the edges were lower than at the corresponding depth close to the center, but still higher than in the non-mulched plots. In plots with Acacia seedlings, the total soil water losses were similar among treatments. However, the cumulative evaporative losses near the soil surface were lower with larger mulched areas. During early growth stages, roots grew deeper in the 30% mulch treatment and more laterally in the other mulched treatments. The non-mulched treatment produced the smallest root system. Larger canopies developed in the mulched treatments and the gross water use efficiency increased with the increasing fraction of the mulched area.

Canopy openness was an important factor affecting understory biomass in hybrid poplar buffers, with lower understory biomass observed on sites and under the clone with lower canopy openness. Although tree size was an important factor affecting canopy openness, relationships between total stem volume and canopy openness, for each clone, also support the hypothesis of a clonal effect on canopy openness. Understory biomass and canopy openness as low as 3.6 g m−2 and 7.6% in 1 m2 microplots were measured under clone MxB-915311 at the most productive site. This reduction of understory plant growth could compromise important buffer functions for water quality protection (runoff control, sediment trapping and surface soil stabilisation), particularly were concentrated runoff flow paths enter the buffer. On the other hand, tree buffers that maintain relatively low canopy openness could be interesting to promote native and wetland plant diversity. Significant positive relationships between canopy openness and introduced species richness (R 2 = 0.46, p < 0.001) and cover (R 2 = 0.51, p < 0.001) were obtained, while no significant relationship was observed between canopy openness and native (wetland) species richness and cover. These results suggest that planting riparian buffer strips of fast-growing trees can rapidly lead to the exclusion of shade-intolerant introduced species, typical colonisers of disturbed habitats such as riparian areas of pastures, while having no significant effect on native (wetland) diversity. Forest canopy created by the poplars was probably an important physical barrier controlling introduced plant richness and abundance in agricultural riparian corridors. A strong linear relationship (R 2 = 0.73) between mean total species richness and mean introduced species richness was also observed, supporting the hypothesis that the richest communities are the most invaded by introduced species, possibly because of higher canopy openness, as seen at the least productive site (low poplar growth). Finally, results of this study highlight the need for a better understanding of relationships between tree growth, canopy openness, understory biomass and plant diversity in narrow strips of planted trees. This would be useful in designing multifunctional riparian buffer systems in agricultural landscapes.@@@Plant species richness

Successful long-term management of a perennial plantation replacing an annual crop requires understanding the system in all phases of the life cycle, and in the case of truffles this involves understanding the interactive growth of the aboveground host and the belowground symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungus whose fruitbody is the desired truffle. Here we focus on the pre-production phase, 4 years after establishing the truffle-oak plantation and prior to truffle production. We tested the influence of weed control, irrigation and fertilizer, each at 3 levels, on plant growth and ectomycorrhizal proliferation in three truffle-oaks plantations in northeast Spain. Results show that adequate weed control improves root and shoot dry weight while fertilizer and irrigation treatments did not influence plant growth. The low dose of irrigation (50% of the estimated water deficit for the site) and glyphosate weed control both increased total root tips/plant and T. melanosporum colonized tips (ectomycorrhizae) by approximately two-fold, compared to control treatments. Distribution of the ectomycorrhizae within the soil profile was significantly influenced by the low dose irrigation treatment, with increases observed in the 10–20 cm and the 20–30 cm deep layers compared to the control and high irrigation treatments. Four years after planting, T. melanosporum remained the dominant fungal symbiont, despite the presence of 14 other ectomycorrhizal morphotypes from these sites.@@@Quercus ilex

The field performance of five stock types of Olga Bay larch (Larix olgensis Henry) seedlings three seasons after planting was evaluated. High survival rates were achieved for all five types of planting stock in the first-year growing season when weeds were controlled. In the second and third-year growing seasons, significant differences were observed in survival rates among different stocktypes. The 1 + 1 type of Olga Bay larch seedling demonstrated better survival than 1 + 0 type of seedlings. 1 + 1 seedlings with diameter larger than 5.0 mm as well as 1 + 0 seedlings with diameter larger than 4.5 mm were suitable for reforestation. The 1 + 1 stocktype with a root collar diameter between 6.0 and 7.5 mm was considered optimal for the establishment of fast-growing and high-yield plantations. The number of lateral roots > 1 cm in length was the best predictor of field performance, however, the number of first order lateral roots with diameter > 1 mm at the tap root junction (FOLR (D > 1 mm)) was more feasible and sufficiently reliable to predict the field performance of the deciduous conifers. The initial height and root collar diameter of seedlings showed a significant correlation with the field performance for both 1 + 1 and 1 + 0 seedlings in the first and second-year growing seasons and thus can be adopted as an indicator for predicting potential field performance of seedlings.@@@Survival

These SOs are located in different bioclimatic domains and contain seed trees originating from geographically and genetically distinct sources. To evaluate the influence of SO on seedling growth and morphology, seedlings produced with seeds originating from the ten most commonly used first-generation white spruce SO in Quebec were raised under similar nursery conditions. Tissue nutrient concentrations of seedlings evolved similarly among seed orchards during the second growing season. At the end of the growing season, only shoot phosphorus concentrations were significantly different. When modeled with a logistic function, there was a significant difference between height and diameter growth curve parameters of seedlings from distinct SO during the second growing season. These differences led to significant differences in the height and shoot dry mass of the seedlings at the end of their second growing season, but not in their diameter or root dry mass. The ten SOs were clustered in two groups according to the above-ground characteristics of their progeny. This limited amount of morphological diversity suggests that expanding the size of the present seed zones may be an appropriate course of action for white spruce seed production in Quebec.@@@Picea glauca

In this study, we measured genetic diversity and population structure using 6 microsatellite loci in 12 populations from Bulgarian mountain ranges. Our analysis showed good intrapopulation divergence (18.22%; AMOVA) and genetic evidence of bottlenecks. “NJ-IAM” and “non-admixing” clusters divided the populations into 3 large groups. Our microsatellite analysis was consistent with the documented “mountain effect” influence on genetic diversity. Two methods—the Coalescent Bayesian model and M-stat analysis—implicated recent bottlenecks for all populations, suggesting that the genetic structure of Bulgarian Scots Pine was shaped over a long period (one thousand generations; i.e. 20,000 years) by the interaction of genetic and autoecological processes. Our results suggest that conservation and management practices should strive to maintain this genetic differentiation, specifically by emphasizing reforestation efforts with stocks from local provenances to avoid nonlocal introductions.@@@Nuclear microsatellite markers

In order to identify the most promising clones in terms of growth and yield and also to assess their stability, trials were established at different locations in Spain. The majority of these clones, which form part of the European list of base materials, have frequently been used in plantations aimed at timber production but not for biomass in Mediterranean conditions. Others, such as those selected in Italy specifically for biomass production (currently provisionally admitted), are being tested for the first time under different soil and climatic conditions in Southwest Europe. The early selection of clones for rapid juvenile growth provides a valuable additional input to the clonal selection process, especially where very short rotations are desired (no more than 3 years). In any case, determining clonal stability in terms of growth is of great use not only when deciding on the clones to be used in plantations but also when developing breeding programs. ANOVA and Genotype plus Genotype × Environment (GGE) biplot analyses were used to analyse the growth and stability of the clones, which were then ranked according to mean performance and stability. Differences were detected between clones as well as between the different environments tested. The biplot analysis allowed different groups of clones to be identified according to their performance and degree of interaction displayed, thus providing useful information for the selection process. The production of aboveground biomass in the first vegetative period ranged from 1.7 to 8.0 Mg DM ha−1 at the different sites. ‘Monviso’, ‘Guardi’, ‘AF2’ and ‘2000 verde’ were the most productive clones whereas ‘Unal’, ‘Pegaso’ and ‘USA 49-177’ were the least productive. The stability analysis identified ‘AF2’, ‘Guardi’, ‘I-214’ and ‘MC’ as more stable clones while ‘Monviso’, ‘2000 verde’, ‘Unal’, ‘Pegaso’ and ‘USA 49-177’ were found to be specifically adapted to certain environments. This implies that where information on site conditions is not available, the ‘AF2’ and ‘Guardi’ clones offer greater assurance of successful establishment and higher initial growth. The growth of ‘Monviso’ ‘2000 verde’ ‘Unal’ ‘Pegaso’ and ‘USA 49-177’ clones is highly dependent on site conditions during the establishment phase. Similarly, the SH (Shore Henares river) and LT (La Tallada) sites were identified as the most highly discriminative environments for the set of clones while CS (Cubo de la Solana) and AR (Atarfe) were identified as those where performance levels were average.@@@Poplar

We employed data from interview surveys with three rubberwood processing companies and statistics from estate rubber plantations and wood retailing companies. The result was that the end use of rubberwood in Cambodia was the sawntimber products, being exported to Vietnam and China. The yield rate from rubberwood stumpage into sawn timber was between 11.6 and 14.9%, closely matching the rates of Malaysia and Thailand. The average production of rubberwood roundwood from 1996 to 2011 was 254,697 m3/year, of which sawn timber as well as residuals in secondary processing was 84,559 and 170,138 m3/year, respectively. Although the timber production of Cambodia has declined sharply due to the strict restriction of natural forest logging, rubberwood could explain more than 60% of the domestic industrial roundwood production from 2000. We suggest the necessity of monitoring the expansion of rubber plantations in new rubber producing countries and linking the rubberwood production with the regional wood resource management.@@@Deforestation

In this region, fallow periods are short, in general, no longer than 7–10 years, and old secondary successional sites are not available. Therefore we evaluated the potential of very early successional stages of tropical dry forest with different land use histories for recovering the structure and composition of regional forest. We compared five early successional sites (7–72 months) with five nearby forest remnants. Successional sites had reached 38 and 30%, respectively, of the average basal area and density recorded for the forest understories, but only 5 and 10%, respectively, of the basal area and density of forest overstories. A total of 132 tree species were recorded, 45 at successional and 107 at forest sites. Individuals of tree species with animal-dispersed seeds (57%) were significantly better represented than wind-dispersed (22%) and self-dispersing (21%) species in both successional and forest sites. Successional sites had already recruited 10% of the intermediate and shade-tolerant species that grow in forest remnants. However, only 20 species occurred in both early successional and forest sites, several showing resprouting ability. We conclude that the entry of forest species to the successional process at very early stages and the recruitment of individuals from resprouting may facilitate the recovery of the dry forest in Veracruz.@@@Dispersal syndrome

The seeds of these species exhibit dormancy, causing delayed germination. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of pre-sowing treatments (scarification, hot water, or soaking) on seed germination of L. leucocephala and A. farnesiana. In one experiment, seeds were exposed to three pre-sowing treatments: control, sandpaper scarification, or soaking in 70°C water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 min. In another experiment, seeds were soaked in 70°C water for 20 min, and then soaked in water at room temperature for an additional 24, 48, or 72 h or blade scarified. In general, soaking the seeds of the two species in hot water was more effective in breaking seed dormancy than scarification. Sandpaper scarification was not effective for either species. Blade scarification increased A. farnesiana seed germination to 56%, indicating that seed dormancy was mainly a consequence of hardseededness. L. leucocephala seeds collected from Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) site and soaked in 70°C water for 20 min and then soaked for 24, 48, or 72 h had germination rates above 97%. Our results suggest that blade scarification of A. farnesiana seeds and soaking of L. leucocephala seeds in 70°C water for 20 min are effective treatments to break seed dormancy and enhance seed germination of these vital species.@@@Leucaena leucocephala

Therefore, there is a need for understanding the carbon sequestration ‘mechanism’ and for ex-ante assessment of the sequestration potential of afforestation projects. Such assessment must be based on parameter estimates that are inherently uncertain, making the basis for applying an advanced sequestration model weak. This paper presents a transparent, simple and general model for quantification of the carbon sequestration in afforestation projects. The model can easily be modified so as to fit specific conditions, and it is held sufficiently reliable when taking into account the ex-ante character of the decision problem. The use of the model is exemplified by application to a yield table for Sitka spruce. Limitations of the model framework and its application in combination with scenarios of climate change are discussed.@@@Analytical model

Novel forests increase in area in response to human activity and there is no information about their biomass accumulation and nutrient cycling. We established allometric relationships and chemically analyzed plant parts of African tulip trees to determine the concentration and standing stock of chemical elements (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Al, Fe, Na), and ash. Trees ranged in diameter at breast height from 8 to 85 cm and in height from 8.8 to 28 m. The concentrations of N, P, K, and Ca in leaves of the African tulip tree were similar to those of the native pioneer Cecropia schreberiana and higher than those of mature forest tree species in Puerto Rico. The over bark wood volume of African tulip trees in nine forest stands where it was dominant ranged from 163 to 849 m3/ha. Aboveground biomass ranged from 60 to 296 Mg/ha, and N and P stocks ranged from 190 to 988 and 32 to 137 kg/ha, respectively.

Plant water availability depends on the precipitation regime, but also on the physical properties of the soil. Higher survival rates result when seedlings are soil acclimated. Our main goal was to describe the morpho-physiological responses of 6-, 10- and 18-month-old Quercus coccifera seedlings growing in a natural soil (terra rossa) or a standard nursery growing medium, and to assess in the nursery if seedlings growing in natural soil were more resistant to deficit irrigation. The high growth rate achieved after 10–18 months by terra rossa-grown seedlings in contrast with those grown in the nursery substrate suggests that the former were acclimated to the soil. Higher photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs) were observed in terra rossa seedlings, mainly during the first months. The higher carbon availability may account for the higher root nitrogen concentration in terra rossa-grown seedlings, which could favor their later field growth. Low-watered seedlings showed a certain degree of hardening, since after 18 months, they showed higher A, E, gs and lower photoinhibition than well-watered seedlings, likely attributable to the sharp leaf-to-root biomass ratio reduction. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) values were similar to those of well-watered plants and indicated a non-stomatal component as the main factor controlling photosynthesis in these leaves. Eighteen-month-old low irrigated seedlings had the highest mortality. Overall, results suggest that nursery terra rossa-acclimated Q. coccifera seedlings with improved physiological status and hydraulic soil-root continuity would have a higher survival rate in the field.@@@Drought stress

Water uptake was studied using sap flow gauges on individual proximal roots and coarse root structure was examined by excavating 18 whole-root systems. Finer roots were scanned and analyzed for architecture. Nitrogen forms did not affect coarse-root system development, but had a significant effect on fine-root development. Nitrate-treated trees presented higher fine:coarse root ratios and higher specific root lengths than control or ammonium treated trees. These allocation differences affected the water uptake capacity of the plants as reflected by the higher sapflow rate in the nitrate treatment. The diameter of proximal roots at the tree base predicted well the total root biomass and length. The diameter of smaller lateral roots also predicted the lateral root mass, length, surface area and the number of tips. The effect of nitrogen fertilisation on the fine root structure translated into an effect on the functioning of the fine roots forming a link between form (architecture) and function (water uptake).@@@Nitrogen fertilisation

However, studies on wood properties are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to group clones with similar wood color characteristics using the CIELab system, and mechanical resistance by dynamic stiffness (Ed) in order to obtain different types of clones for different climate and edaphic conditions. It was found that lightness (L*), yellowness (b*), redness (a*), and Ed are similar to those found for other plantation trees. These wood characteristics are significantly influenced by clone and site. Variance due to clone and site went from 31 to 53% and from 2.95 to 24.22%, respectively. Another source of variance was distance from pith, with the exception of parameter b*, which was not affected. Finally, clones were grouped (using multivariate analysis) according to color and mechanical resistance. This analysis established 4 groups by color and 5 groups by Ed. Clone clustering will allow us to choose or use clones with similar wood properties according to site and environmental conditions increasing area production and wood quality uniformity.@@@Environment

Nodal segments of fresh shoot sprouts originated from axillary buds obtained from a plant around 35–40 years old lopped plant were used as explants for establishment of in vitro cultures. Surface-sterilized explants produced optimum number of shoots through activation of axillary buds on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium containing 8.88 μM BA (6-benzyladenine) + additives (25 mgl−1 each of adenine sulphate, arginine, citric acid, 50 mgl−1 ascorbic acid).

In many areas, seedlings require some form of protection if they are to survive and grow into a productive plantation. Two general approaches for reducing browsing damage to seedlings are to apply chemical repellents and tree guards. Both methods have existed for a long time, and new variations are constantly being developed. Seedling stocking guards, a type of tree guard, are being used operationally in Tasmania, Australia, but there is limited data quantifying their effectiveness and concerns with negative effects on tree performance. Conversely, although proven effective, repellents are not being used, but are potentially cheaper and less problematic. We therefore aimed to determine which is more effective under operational conditions, whether this effectiveness can be improved or extended, and if either treatment has any effects on seedling form or survival. We planted Eucalyptus nitens seedlings with combinations of repellent and stocking guards in six operational plantations to examine and compare their effectiveness. Seedlings were monitored for 12 months to examine treatment longevity. We found that both stocking guards and repellent significantly reduced and delayed browsing severity, with their effects being additive. No negative effects on growth were evident after 12 months, but adverse effects on seedling form warrant further investigation. Both of these methods can be easily and relatively cheaply applied in the nursery before planting, making them appealing options to reduce browsing. However, the ideal method for a given site will depend upon local browsing intensity.@@@Browsing

Typically, this has involved the application of allometric equations utilising diameter and height, but for accurate results, these equations are often specific to species, site, and silvicultural treatment. In this study, we assessed the value of incorporating a third piece of information: the height of diameter measurement. We derived a more general volume equation, based on the conical approximation, using a diameter projected to the base of the tree. Common equations were developed which allowed an accurate estimate of stem volume, dry weight and nutrient content across two key plantation grown eucalypt species, Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden and Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.). The conical model was developed with plantation-grown E. grandis trees ranging from 0.28 to 15.85 m in height (1.05 g to 80.3 kg stem wood dry weight), and E. globulus trees ranging from 0.10 to 34.4 m in height (stem wood dry weight from 0.48 g to 652 kg), grown under a range of contrasting cultural treatments, including spacing (E. grandis), site (E. globulus) and fertilization (nitrogen and phosphorus) for both species. With log transformed data the conical function (Vcon) was closely related to stem sectional volume over bark and stem weight (R2 = 0.996 and 0.990, respectively) for both E. grandis and E. globulus, and the same regressions can be applied to both species. Back transformed data compared with the original data yielded modelling efficiencies of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Relationships between Vcon and bark dry weight differed for the two species, reflecting differing bark characteristics. Young trees with juvenile foliage had a different form of relationship to older trees with intermediate or adult foliage, the change of slope corresponding to heights about 1.5 m for E. grandis and age 1 year for E. globulus. The Vcon model proved to be robust, and unlike conventional models, does not need additional parameters for estimating biomass under different cultural treatments. More than 99% of the statistical variance of the logarithm of biomass was accounted for in the model. Vcon captures most of the change in stem taper associated with cultural treatments and some of the change in stem form that occurs after the crown base has lifted appreciably. Fertilization increased N and P concentrations in stem wood and bark, and regressions to estimate N and P contents (the products of biomass and concentration) were dependent on treatment. For instance, there was a large growth response to N fertilization in E. globulus corresponding with a change (P < 0.05) in the intercept of the regression to estimate N content.@@@Biomass estimation

The aim is to develop trees that will grow in relatively dry and/or saline environments and provide commercial wood products. Previous studies indicate that the hybrids exhibit faster growth than either of their pure species parents, and that there are significant differences in growth rates between them. We undertook a comparative study of the partitioning of above-ground biomass (AGB) to examine biomass and chloride (Cl) allocation of trees growing on two saline-irrigated sites in south-eastern Australia. Eucalyptus camaldulensis × globulus had a higher proportion of AGB in leaves (20–29% cf. 15–16%), and lower proportion in live branches (3–10% cf. 6–14%) than E. camaldulensis × grandis. The concentration of Cl was highest in the stembark (4.2–9.6 g kg−1) and lowest in the stemwood (0.6–2.0 g kg−1), suggesting that trees can export Cl through bark shedding. Total Cl content was strongly related to volume under bark (R2 = 0.99), and differences in partitioning of Cl into tree components differed between the hybrids in the same way as AGB. Preferential partitioning of Cl to live branches rather than foliage in E. camaldulensis × grandis suggests that this hybrid may be compartmentalising Cl to reduce the risk of Cl toxicity in the leaves.@@@Salinity

"574","Foliar herbivory and leaf traits of five native tree species in a young plantation of Central Panama@@@@@@Received: 28 July 2010 Accepted: 26 April 2011 Published: 07 May 2011 Issue Date: January 2012@@@This study examined foliar herbivory on 1 year-old tree saplings planted in previously abandoned fields in central Panama. Plots (15 × 15 trees) of Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae), Dalbergia retusa (Fabaceae), Pachira quinata (Malvaceae), Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae), and Terminalia amazonia (Combretaceae) were tested for herbivory using leaf counts and digital image analysis. Values of foliar carbon, foliar nitrogen, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf toughness were analyzed to describe mechanical defenses and leaf nutrients on young and mature leaves of each of these species. For all five species, less than 10% of total leaf area was found to be damaged by arthropods. Significant (P-value < 0.001) differences in herbivory were found among both the tree species and the insect feeding guilds considered: chewing, skeletonizing, mining, and leaf-rolling. On mature leaves, Anacardium excelsum had the highest amount of leaf damage (3.53%) while Dalbergia retusa exhibited the lowest herbivore damage (1.72%). Tabebuia rosea had statistically significantly higher damage than other species for young leaves caused by leaf-rolling insects (4.21% rolling of 5.55% total damage). Leaf toughness was negatively correlated with SLA and foliar N. Linear regressions showed that herbivory was positively correlated with foliar N for young leaves and negatively correlated with foliar N for mature leaves. No statistically significant relationships were found between herbivory and the mechanical properties of toughness and SLA. Overall, results from this study indicate that, as young saplings, the species evaluated did not suffer high amounts of foliar herbivory in the plantation environment.@@@Central America

The optimal fertilization practice is that which maximizes seedling growth and minimizes nutrient loss. We tested three fertilization strategies: (1) constant fertilization (2) a three-stage rate, and (3) exponential fertilization on Liriodendron tulipifera and Larix leptolepis containerized seedlings. Growth performance, nutrient uptake, and nutrient loss in leaching were measured. Height, root collar diameter, and dry weight of both species were not significantly different among treatments even though the nutrient supply of the exponential treatment was half that of the constant and three-stage treatments. Generally, nutrient losses in leached solutions were higher in constant and three-stage than the exponential treatment. Nutrient use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the nutrient content of the seedlings to the amount of nutrient applied to the containers. The nitrogen use efficiency in the constant, three-stage, and exponential treatments was 63, 61, and 85% for yellow poplar, respectively, and 35, 30, and 53% for larch. Similar results were obtained for phosphorus and potassium. Thus, the exponential treatment had the highest nutrient use efficiency as well as the least nutrient loss. Adjusting fertilization rates can reduce soil and water contamination around the nursery without compromising growth performance, which reduces both producer’s investments and environmental impacts.@@@Biomass

The experiment was carried out in Forestry Laboratory at Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University, Iran. The collected seeds were treated with boiling water and H2SO4 then left to germinate in controlled growth chamber. Seed were grown under salinity levels 100, 200 and 300 mM of CaCl2, NaH2PO4, KNO3 and KH2PO4. Germination parameters and various seedling growth variables such as root and stem length, seedlings fresh and dry weight were measured after 56 days. Results showed that germination percentage significantly decreased as the salinity level of medium increased. Salinity treatments at 100 mM enhanced the percentage of seeds germination and significantly improved the germination index and seeds stamina. In this study, the best treatment was 100 mM salinity for biomass production of seedlings. For Prosopis juliflora, 100 mM salinity significantly enhanced both germination and biomass production.@@@Prosopis juliflora

Additionally, seasonal mean daily solar radiation and temperature were recorded on each aspect over the same time period. Height and diameter growth were both strongly seasonal; mean diameter growth was highest in the spring (0.91 cm) while height growth was greatest in the summer (0.57 m). Conversely, diameter and height growth were least in the winter (0.38 cm and 0.09 m respectively). There was a significant interaction between season and aspect for height (P = 0.01) and diameter (P = 0.02). Diameter and height growth on the shady face was similar to that on the sunny slopes during summer, but, in winter growth on the shady face was typically lower than the sunny. Slope position also influenced height growth (P = 0.001), particularly in the winter, growth on the lower slope being less than on the upper. There was a strong linear relationship between seasonal height growth and solar radiation but a curvilinear relationship between seasonal diameter growth and radiation. Consideration of the influence of topography on solar radiation and other environmental factors may allow more reliable assessment of potential forest production on a micro scale.@@@Eucalyptus species

At both Ba Vi and Yen Thanh there were significant (P < 0.001) differences in height and diameter at breast height (DBH) among 22 tested clones at 4 years. At Long Thanh, twelve hybrid clones did not differ significantly in DBH at age 3 years, but did (P < 0.001) at age 5 years. At the two northern sites the acacia hybrid clones had significantly greater DBH than control seedlots of the parental species. At Long Thanh, DBH of the hybrid clones and A. mangium was similar, with a genetically improved seedlot of A. mangium displaying the best DBH. Mean wood basic density at breast height of the acacia hybrid clones was 539 kg m−3 at Yen Thanh at age 8 years, and 473 kg m−3 at Long Thanh at age 5 years; density for A. mangium at Long Thanh was only slightly lower than the hybrid clones at 461 kg m−3. Linear regressions of Pilodyn penetration (PP) at breast height on wood basic density explained 60% of the variance in density of treatments (clones and control seedlots) at Yen Thanh and 36% at Long Thanh. There were significant differences between hybrid clones in PP at all three trial sites. Clonal DBH performance was not strongly correlated across the three trial sites; Pearson correlations of clone mean DBH between pairs of sites ranged from −0.47 to 0.20. Clonal rankings for PP were more stable, with Pearson correlations between pairs of sites ranging from r = 0.71 to 0.78.@@@Acacia mangium × auriculiformis hybrid

Plant establishment and the vegetation differences between the degraded ecosystem’s previous state and the new state following reforestation were measured in order to evaluate the effect of reforestation. Monitoring of the seedling survival and growth of the planted species was carried out during the next five years. In the fifth year we conducted botanical inventories in 18 and 15 plots (50 m2 in size) from the reforested and control area, respectively. Plant community parameters estimated were: vegetation composition, total plant cover, planted species cover, native woody, herb and grass species cover, plant species richness, Shannon-Weiner index, community structure and dominant plant height. P. halepensis exhibited higher survival and growth than P. pinea. The reforested area exhibited higher plant diversity, higher vegetation cover, taller plants and more complex community structures than the control area, which concludes that plantings of pines can be successfully used in degraded ecosystem reforestation projects, in areas with similar site conditions.@@@Diversity

ANOVA and correlation analysis were used to identify species and microsite effects, and nutrient associations. Significant (P ≤ 0.0014) species differences were identified for all nutrients, E. botryoides and E. saligna generally had high nutrient concentrations while stringybark species were low, particularly for N and K. Subgeneric contrasts revealed that Symphyomyrtus species had significantly higher concentrations of P (P = 0.05) N, K and Ca (P < 0.0001) but lower Mg (P < 0.0001) than Monocalyptus. Microsite had less influence on nutrient concentrations than species. N was strongly positively correlated with P and K in most Symphyomyrtus species but was not correlated with P in Monocalyptus. Mg was positively correlated with Ca but negatively correlated with K in most species. The results indicate that Monocalyptus and Symphyomyrtus species differ in ability to accumulate key macronutrients.@@@Eucalyptus species

"581","Designing Nelder wheel plots for tree density experiments@@@@@@Received: 12 November 2010 Accepted: 29 June 2011 Published: 10 July 2011 Issue Date: March 2012@@@The Nelder (Biometrics 18:283–307, 1962) wheel design allows a researcher to test multiple tree densities in a single plot. Because spatial relationships among planted trees are fundamental to a Nelder wheel, a researcher needs a specific set of layout parameters to establish a Nelder plot. While Nelder (Biometrics 18:283–307, 1962) provides calculus-based equations for determining the required layout parameters, the presentation focuses on derivation of these equations and not their application to forestry research. Other authors have outlined the design of Nelder plots for forestry research, but have done so using trigonometry-based equations. Existence of two layout methodologies in the literature is a source of confusion. In this paper, we present a straightforward means to determine the design parameters critical to the establishment of Nelder plots used within tree density research. The layout equations presented are expressed in terms that allow applied forestry researchers to easily answer the following question. Given the number and range of tree densities I want to evaluate, what are the required Nelder wheel layout parameters? Finally, we provide a step-by-step example of the design and installation of a Nelder plot for a scenario familiar to tree density research and discuss analysis of Nelder wheel experiments.@@@Experimental design

Effects of plant growth regulator NAA (naphthaleneacetic acid) and BAP (6-benzylaminopurine), sucrose and AgNO3 on callus induction, adventitious bud differentiation and shoot development were examined. Explants used were epicotyl fragments from 45-day-old seedlings. The largest callus (4.29 mm in diameter) was obtained after 1 month on a basic culture medium consisting of Murashige and Skoog ½ macro- and full strength micro- elements, Nitsch and Nitsch vitamins, supplemented with 0.54 μM NAA, 3.30 μM BAP, and 30 g L−1 sucrose. The calli were subcultured in the same medium above for 2 months. They were then cultured for another 2 months for adventitious bud differentiation and shoot development. The highest mean adventitious bud differentiation, number of shoots formed per callus and number of shoots ≥2 cm long per callus (47.50%, 27.38 and 4.75, respectively) were achieved on the above medium modified with NAA at 0.27 μM and supplemented with AgNO3 1 mg L−1. Shoots were successfully rooted without plant growth regulator and the rooted plantlets survived and grew normally. This protocol for in vitro plant regeneration provides a tool not only for vegetative propagation but also for plant genetic transformation and gene function studies of C. cunninghamiana.@@@Casuarina cunninghamiana

There is also poor documentation of nutrient budgets for teak, therefore, a pot experiment with optimal hybrid regression design (Roquemore R311A) was implemented with calcium, boron and nitrogen treatments with teak seedlings (Tectona grandis L.f.) planted in acidic lateritic red soil substrate. Seedling growth, biomass production and root development, and soil pH, and exchangeable Ca and Al concentration were measured. Plant height, root collar diameter, biomass of leaves, stems and roots, root volume, taproot length, number of lateral roots of teak seedlings were significantly and positively correlated with soil exchangeable Ca, pH and Ca/Al molar ratio, and negatively correlated with exchangeable Al. All growth traits were significantly affected by calcium, nitrogen and their interaction, but B fertilizer and other interactions had insignificant effects. To effectively cultivate teak seedlings in acidic soil substrates, 1.68 g kg−1 quicklime (CaO) and 0.65 g kg−1 urea was suggested to be added to neutralize soil acidity, and enhance soil exchangeable Ca content and Ca/Al molar ratio. Urea should not be added without quicklime.@@@Tectona grandis

Little information could be found if tree form differs between coppiced (where one or two stems had been left per stump) and planted eucalypts, or whether different volume taper models would need to be developed. To determine if this was necessary, rotation-end stem taper data was collected from an Eucalyptus grandis × E. urophylla and an E. grandis × E. camaldulensis trial to compare volume taper equations for planted versus coppiced commercially grown Eucalyptus clonal hybrids. For treatment comparisons, taper data were collected from the parent crop (1R), the replanted crop (2R), as well as from coppiced stands where either a single (Cop_Sngl) or double stem (Cop_Dbl) had been left per stump. Stem taper functions used for treatment comparisons indicated differences between clones, as well as between treatment, with the models based on single stems (1R, 2R or Cop_Sngl) being significantly different from those containing two stems (Cop_Dbl). Despite any non-significant model differences (for example between 1R, 2R and Cop_Sngl single stem crops) the percentage magnitude of any bias in utilizable volume differences when comparing the individual models (between a 6.31% over-prediction to a 3.8% under-prediction) still needs to be taken into account as these differences may have importance in terms of the volume and product prediction.@@@Eucalyptus

However, cover crops may compete with the trees for water and other nutrients than N. This study was carried out to assess whether soil fertility, tree survival and growth could be improved by incorporating leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops into the Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) production system. Dutch white clover (Trifolium pratense), alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were grown in a newly established Fraser fir plantation using two cover crop management practices; no banding (NB) by growing each cover crop throughout the entire plot and banding (B) by creating a 61 cm-wide bare zone centered on the tree rows. A conventionally-managed system (CONV) was used as a control. The cover crop aboveground biomass and N content were assessed. Soil available N (NO3− and NH4+) and N mineralization were measured at 0–15, 15–30 and 30–45 cm soil depths. Tree survival, growth, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), branch water potential (Ψw) and foliar nutrients were also evaluated. Biomass production was as high as 13.9, 10.2 and 5.9 Mg DM ha−1 year−1 for clover, alfalfa and ryegrass, respectively. Cover cropping increased soil available N by 1.5- and 2.2-fold relative the CONV in the top soil layer in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Tree seedling survival and growth in the B and CONV systems were similar. In contrast, NB treatments resulted in poor seedling survival and growth relative to the B and CONV plots. Plant Ψw and Fv/Fm decreased significantly for A. fraseri seedlings on the NB treatments relative to their counterparts on the B and CONV plots. However, cover cropping had marginal effects on foliar nutrients. Cover cropping with banding can be an efficient strategy for maintaining productivity in Fraser fir Christmas plantations.@@@Plantation

The objective of our study was to determine carbon in various components (leaves, branches, stems, structural roots and soil) of single-species plantations of Vochysia guatemalensis and Hieronyma alchorneoides from 0 to 16 years of age. Carbon fraction in the biomass, mean (±standard deviation), for the different pools varied between 38.5 and 49.7% (±3 and 3.8). Accumulated carbon in the biomass increased with the plantation age, with mean annual increments of 7.1 and 5.3 Mg ha−1 year−1 for forest plantations of V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides, respectively. At all ages, 66.3% (±10.6) of total biomass was found within the aboveground tree components, while 18.6% (±20.9) was found in structural roots. The soil (0–30 cm) contained 62.2 (±13) and 71.5% (±17.1) of the total carbon (biomass plus soil) under V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides, respectively. Mean annual increment for carbon in the soil was 1.7 and 1.3 Mg ha−1 year−1 in V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides. Allometric equations were constructed to estimate total biomass and carbon in the biomass which had an R 2aj (adjusted R square) greater than 94.5%. Finally, we compare our results to those that could have resulted from the use of default values, showing how site and species specific data contribute to the overall goal of improving carbon estimates and providing a more reliable account of the mitigation potential of forestry activities on climate change.@@@Allometric equations

Media-filled pots were treated with sulfometuron methyl (Oust®) in varying concentrations and planted with seedlings of Larix occidentalis Nutt., Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, and Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don. Seedlings were grown in two trials to determine the effects of two important residue breakdown factors, substrate moisture and pH, relative to that of herbicide application rate on seedling health. Changes in seedling height, root-collar diameter, and root volume were morphologic variables of interest, and physiological variables measured were net photosynthetic assimilation, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. While three levels of media moisture and four levels of media pH had no effect on seedling performance, most growth and leaf function variables were hindered across application rate treatments of all three species. Label-recommended dosages resulted in growth suppression levels potentially detrimental to seedling establishment for all three species. This was most pronounced for Pinus monticola, in particular for root growth, where untreated control seedlings showed 109% more root volume growth than treated seedlings. We conclude that when possible, a species-specific application rate might be found that balances the benefits of vegetation control with the phytotoxicity to promote optimal growth gains.@@@Herbicide

MBF integrates elements of X-radiographic seed quality assessment and mark-recapture methods from wildlife population sampling. Given a sample drawn from a population, individual seeds with attributes targeted for separation are labelled with a mark which biases the subsequent removal probability of other, non-marked seeds in the lot during grading and processing, after returning the sample to the population. Bias in the marking filter, in the form of extra mass or density added to seeds, minimizes the likelihood that uncertainty due to sampling error in the prior estimate will result in empty seeds remaining in the population during processing. In two experiments, a ponderosa pine seed lot was partitioned into empty and filled fractions with an air column separator. Powder dye talc was used for marking in the first trial, with low bias (<1%) and a small sample size (n = 150) with dry (2% moisture content) and soaked (26% moisture content) seed lots. A second trial conducted with two coats of spray paint used for marking and a larger sample size (n = 400) resulted in removal of 100% of non-filled seeds in the population. A simulation was conducted to evaluate sample statistics upon which to base the value of threshold bias, τ, below which seeds in an X-rayed sample should be marked to achieve consistent separation. Estimating the marking threshold based on quantiles of filled seeds most consistently resulted in removal of the non-filled fraction. MBF is a useful method for statistically linking one or more individual seed quality attributes extracted from X-ray image analysis with population-level processing of seed lots.@@@Conifer seed

T. Blake × E. tereticornis Smith were used for quantitative genetic analysis of cold hardiness (CH) and growth traits height (H), diameter at breast height (D) and volume (V) at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 4 years of age. The effect of E. tereticornis male variance was significant (P < 0.05) for CH as well as 2.5- and 4-year-old growth except for H 4, and E. urophylla female × E. tereticornis male interaction was significant for 0.5- and 1.5-year-old growth and CH except for CH 0.5, whereas E. urophylla female effect was not significant for the majority of traits analyzed. Both additive and dominance gene action were present in the genetics of all the traits measured at most ages, indicating that those traits may be improved by hybrid breeding. The σ 2D /σ 2A ratios tended to decline after 1.5 years of age in CH and growth traits, implying that breeding value predictions derived from older performance might be more reliable. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability (h 2) for CH and growth ranged from 0.03 ± 0.05 to 0.28 ± 0.13, depending on trait and age. Additive genetic correlations between CH and V were 0.28 ± 0.48 and 0.69 ± 0.30 at ages 1.5 and 2.5, respectively, suggesting that selection for growth would cause a favorable increase in cold hardiness in E. urophylla × E. tereticornis hybrids.@@@Genetic parameters

The natural substrate was supplemented by adding a 0.2 m layer of a fine textured soil (RS plots) or a sewage sludge amended soil (RSS plots). The treatments were performed when the pines were 7 years old, and tree growth (height and trunk and canopy diameter) was monitored over the subsequent 12 years. The reproductive status of the trees was also measured when the pines were 20 years old. Tree growth was proportional to the amount of soil nutrients: 12 years after treatment the mean height of the R, RS and RSS trees was 1.5, 3.1 and 6.2 m respectively and growth increases over the baseline were 76, 264 and 632%. The treatment also affected the age of onset of reproduction (15, 11 and 9 years, respectively), the average number of cones per tree (12, 43 and 61), and the amount of seeds per cone (37, 52 and 72), but did not modify the germination percentage of pine seeds (ca 71.5%). Soil organic carbon increased proportionally to the vegetation development, contributing to carbon sequestration. These results suggest that improving the nutritional status of the soil not only improves the growth of trees, but it also ameliorates their reproductive ability (earlier reproduction onset and larger seed crop size). Implications for soil restoration through afforestation are also discussed.@@@Afforestation

Contour trench (CT), gradonie (G), box trench (BT) and V-ditch (VD) with a control were prepared in <10%, 10–20% and >20% slopes and Acacia catechu L. seedlings were planted in August 2005 to enhance soil water, nutrient and biomass and to rehabilitate degraded hill. Soil pH, SOC and NH4-N decreased while EC, NO3-N and PO4-P increased in June 2009. Soil water, nutrients, plant growth and biomass were highest (P < 0.05) in <10% and lowest in 10–20% slopes. Soil waters were 13 and 52% greater in >20 and <10% than in soil at 10–20% slope. The soil waters were 18, 16, 24 and 14% greater in CT, G, BT and VD treatments, respectively over control, which enhanced plant height and collar diameter in December 2009 over 2005. The highest growth and biomass were in CT and VD plots, respectively. Herbage biomass was highest (P < 0.05) in <10% slope in 2005, 10–20% slope in 2006/2008 and >20% slope in 2007/2009. Harvesting of rainwater increased herbage biomass by 24–71%, and was highest in VD plots. Conclusively, rainwater harvesting enhanced soil water, nutrients, vegetation covers and plant growth and biomass during restoration of degraded hills. Gradonie and CT/BT facilitated herbage and plant growth, respectively, whereas V-ditch was effective for both.@@@Afforestation

Based on a few dozen field trials, a range of genetic gains for height growth was incorporated into a stand simulator. Technically genetic gain was modelled into individual growth models by applying the Chapman-Richards type function and using genetic gain estimates as asymptotic scaling parameters. Stand projections, including the effect of genetic gain, were further converted into monetary terms by calculating bare land values, i.e. BLVs according to the Faustman rotation model. Following this, the financial attractiveness of using improved seed material from Scots pine was determined by comparing the BLVs between stands with and without genetic gain. The study focused on the private forest owner’s point of view, reflecting the primary demand conditions for improved seed material. Comparisons between BLVs indicated that using improved seed material of Scots pine would be financially viable for private forest owners in most parts of Finland, the discount rate being 3%. The main results were robust, with pertinent changes in silvicultural costs and stumpage prices. This study demonstrates the need for financial analysis in decision-making in the context of regeneration material.@@@Genetic gain

A system to predict which tree species are likely to be suitable for direct seeding would therefore be useful for improving forest restoration projects. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of seed traits on the success of direct seeding to restore tropical forest in southern Thailand. Seeds of 19 indigenous lowland tropical forest tree species were collected, from both the east and west sides of the Thailand peninsular and the following parameters measured: seed size, shape, coat thickness and moisture content. Field trials were established to determine seed germination rates and to calculate a “direct seeding suitability score” for each species, which combined seedling establishment and growth rates. Seed size, shape and moisture content were associated with germination percentage. Species with higher seedling survival tended to have large or intermediate-sized seeds, round or oval seeds and seeds with low or medium moisture content. Only seed coat thickness was significantly correlated with the suitability score (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Seed coat thickness >0.4 mm coincided with higher rank suitability score. These conditions successfully predicted the success or failure of direct seeding for 15 out of 19 species tested. Eight tree species are recommended as suitable for restoring lowland evergreen forest ecosystems in southern Thailand, by direct seeding.@@@Direct sowing

Twenty-five trees (mother trees) were selected from each SS, SO and P seed sources and were screened with 11 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Estimated genetic diversity parameters were found to be generally high in all Anatolian black pine seed sources and the majority of genetic diversity is contained within seed sources (94%). No significant difference in genetic diversity parameters (numbers of effective alleles, % of polymorphic loci and heterozygosity) among seed source categories was found, except for a slight increase in observed heterozygosities in seed orchards. For all seed source categories, observed heterozygosity values were higher (Ho = 0.49 for SS, 0.55 for SO and 0.49 for P) than expected ones (He = 0.40 for SS, 0.39 for SO and 0.38 for P) indicating the excess of heterozygotes. In general, genetic diversity in seed stands has been transferred successfully into seed orchards and plantations. However, the use of seeds from seed orchards can increase the amount of genetic diversity in plantations further. The study also demonstrated that number of plus-tree clones (25–38) used in the establishment of seed orchards was adequate to capture the high level of diversity from natural stands.@@@Anatolian black pine

Reliable estimates of aboveground biomass stocks within the Atlantic Forest are rarely available. Past human disturbance is an important factor affecting forest structure variation and biomass accumulation among tropical forest ecosystems. To support the efforts of improving the quality of estimations of the current and future biomass carbon storage capacity of this disturbed forest region we tested a non-experimental small scale approach to compare the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) of forest sites. Three sites with known disturbance histories have been investigated: complete cut down, selective logging and conservation since 70 years. The woody plant community (dbh ≥ 10 cm) was censused and canopy openness in conjunction with leaf area index has been obtained by hemispherical photographs at each site. Estimates of aboveground tree biomass have been carried out using an allometric equation for moist tropical forests already applied for the study area. Additionally, a FAO standard equation has been employed for crosschecking our results. We identified significant differences in recent AGB of the three compared forest sites. With 313 (±48 Mg ha−1) the highest AGB-values have been found in the preserved forest area within a National Park, followed by 297 (±83) Mg ha−1 at the former clear cut site. Lowest AGB has been calculated for the area with past selective logging: 204 (±38) Mg ha−1. Values calculated with the FAO standard equation showed the same trend but at a lower AGB level. Our results based an a small scale approach suggest that biomass productivity can recover in a forest which was completely cleared 60 years ago to reach AGB values up to a level that almost represents the situation in a preserved forest. Selective logging may slow down AGB accumulation and the effect is measurable after several decades.@@@Aboveground live biomass

With the objective of finding long-term sustainable supply of growing media, compost was produced from shredded branches of three fast growing species (Acacia cyanophylla (AA), Acacia cyclops (AS) and Eucalyptus gomphocephala (EG). The composting process covered three different periods over the course of a year. Pile temperatures were monitored daily and the composts were routinely sampled and analyzed for 19 chemical variables. Although composting is feasible year-round in arid climates, compost produced in the humid cool conditions of autumn, winter and early spring reaches the maturation phase more quickly than compost produced under hot, dry summer conditions. It also requires less turning and water. The evolution of the composting process and quality of the final product can be assessed using three chemical variables (C/N, pH, EC). Seed germination rates in the three types of compost were similar to that in a peat:vermiculite substrate and vigorous high quality seedlings were produced in the two acacia composts. However, compost-grown seedlings had significantly smaller shoots and root systems than those produced in peat substrate. Principal components analyses showed that the quality of a compost-based substrate is reproducible and that its final chemical composition can be predicted from its raw organic materials. The EG composts had higher pH than the acacia composts, whereas the AA and EG composts were higher in mineral salts than the AS.@@@Nursery substrates

Most plantations are typically softwood dominated and managed for sawlog and pulpwood production, while high-yield hardwood plantations for bioenergy feedstocks have not been as widely investigated. The objective of this study was to compare the biomass production of planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) plantations (four clones) in monoculture, and in mixture of the two on a typical reforestation site in Maine. Three years following planting, hybrid poplar height and ground line diameter growth rates began to diverge among clones, and by 6 years, the Populus nigra × Populus maximowiczii (NM6) clone clearly outperformed three Populus deltoides × Populus nigra clones (D51, DN10 and DN70) both in pure stands and in mixtures with white spruce. In mixture, we found the yield of white spruce to decline as the yield of hybrid poplar increased. Overall, yields of white spruce monocultures were comparable to those reported in eastern Canada, while the hybrid poplar biomass yields were substantially lower than those reported from studies on abandoned agricultural lands, likely due to the harsher soil conditions at our site. The dominance of rocky and poorly drained sites (like the one tested in this study) across Maine will likely limit the feasibility of widespread hybrid poplar plantations, and thus constrains their potential use as a bioenergy feedstock.@@@Mixed-species plantations

Craib is an endemic and dominant species in typical sub-alpine dark coniferous forests distributed in mountainous regions of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. We investigated the ecophysiological responses of A. fabri seedlings to short-term artificially-applied drought, nitrogen addition alone, and the combination of these treatments. Drought was created by excluding natural precipitation with an automatically controlled plastic roof that covered the seedlings. Nitrogen fertilization was applied weekly by spraying over seedlings with ammonium nitrate solution. Experiment results showed that drought caused a reduction in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and leaf mass per area. Nitrogen addition enhanced photosynthetic performance by increasing net photosynthetic rate. In the drought plots, nitrogen addition increased net photosynthetic rate and instantaneous water use efficiency. These results showed that applied nitrogen improved plant water use efficiency and N accumulation in plant organs under drought conditions. Especially under drought conditions more N was concentrated into needles by applied nitrogen as compared with other organs. In conclusion, our results indicated that the combination of nitrogen addition and drought may result in positive effects on A. fabri seedlings in the short-term.@@@C concentration

Franco). After girdling treatments, male cone yield increased significantly in the next growing season. The increase was 14-fold in genotype 9137. In genotype 9550, more than 8,700 male cones were induced from each tree whereas no male cones were found in controls. Female cone yield was zero in controls and low for girdled trees in both genotypes. Multiple phytohormone-related compounds, including gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and their selected metabolites, were analyzed in developing long shoots after girdling treatments by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Concentrations of GA4 were slightly higher at week 2 following girdling treatment, whereas at week 8 lower GA4 concentrations were found in girdled samples. Stem girdling did not affect concentrations of IAA and major cytokinins, such as zeatin riboside and isopentenyl adenosine. Concentrations of ABA differed two-fold between the genotypes. Although girdling treatment did not cause differences in ABA concentrations, it generally resulted in higher concentrations of ABA glucose ester. Concentration increase of 7′-hydroxy ABA by girdling was only found in genotype 9550 at week 8. Girdling caused little change in concentrations of phaseic acid in both genotypes.@@@Cone yield

This is especially true for species, such as Pinus patula Schiede and Deppe ex Schltdl. and Cham., which are highly susceptible to the pitch canker fungus Fusarium circinatum. Losses due to F. circinatum have been confined mostly to nurseries and at field establishment resulting in a significant cost to the industry. Although, the fungus has not as yet resulted in stem and branch infections on established P. patula in South Africa, it has caused pitch canker on other, more susceptible species such as P. radiata D. Don., and P. greggii Engelm. ex Parl. As alternatives to P. patula, on the warmer and cooler sites in South Africa, families of P. elliottii Engelm var. elliottii, P. tecunumanii (Schw.) Eguiluz and Perry, P. maximinoi H. E. Moore and P. pseudostrobus Lindl. were screened for tolerance to infection by F. circinatum in greenhouse studies. Seedlings were wounded and inoculated with spores of F. circinatum. Lesion development following inoculation was used to differentiate the levels of tolerance between families. The results showed that P. maximinoi, P. pseudostrobus, and the low elevation variety of P. tecunumanii are highly tolerant to infection with very little family variation. The narrow sense heritability estimates for these species were less than 0.06. In contrast, P. elliottii showed good tolerance with some family variation and a heritability of 0.22, while the high elevation source of P. tecunumanii showed a high degree of family variation and a heritability of 0.59. These results provide the industry with valuable information on pine species tolerant to F. circinatum that could be used as alternatives to P. patula in South Africa.@@@Camcore

Survival was uniformly high (≥80%) regardless of treatment, indicating that site preparation was not necessary to establish pine on this site. Significant treatment effects on height, diameter, and stem volume were present at all assessment dates, but only the windrow burning treatment was associated with growth gains over the untreated control after two decades. Pine planted at the disk trench hinge were significantly larger than control pine only until year five. Of the mechanical treatments, only coarse mixing (by bedding plow) continued to have a significant effect on pine growth for as many as 9 years after treatment. Despite the disappearance of significant differences between mechanical treatments and the untreated control by year 20, the magnitude of stand volume increases suggests the potential for mechanical site preparation to have a beneficial effect on future timber supply. Repeated measures analysis confirmed that trends in early diameter growth differed between the untreated control and the windrow burning or coarse mixing treatments. These data are also potentially valuable for verifying growth and yield or carbon budgeting modelling tools.@@@Mechanical site preparation

Borkh) and the latest blight resistant American chestnut × Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) hybrids. Planted seedlings of chestnut, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) were subjected to two levels of light and two soil types in parallel field and greenhouse studies. The field study took place in the Appalachian ridge and valley province of Virginia. Growth and survival were quantified after three growing seasons. The interaction between light levels and topographic position (soil type) was significant for growth rates in the field and greenhouse. Species were significantly different from each other although hybrid varieties were not significantly different from each other or from pure American chestnut. Tulip poplar showed the greatest growth rates under all treatments in the field. Both tulip poplar and chestnut had the greatest growth rates in large gaps within mesic, mid and lower slope (MML) sites in the field. In contrast to growth, optimal conditions for survival differed among species. Tulip poplar had the greatest survival (71%) within large gaps in MML sites while chestnuts and oaks had the greatest overall survival (64%) in small gaps within xeric, upper slope and ridge (XUR) sites. In the greenhouse, tulip poplar did not outperform chestnut. Discrepancies in field and greenhouse studies were accounted for by uncontrolled factors, such as rodent predation. We conclude that optimal sites for planting American chestnut hybrids are in small gaps located within XUR sites.@@@Restoration

Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S gene intergenic spacer (ITS) showed that these two bacterial strains were closely related to Burkholderia cepacia and they were also similar in carbon source utilization using Biolog GN2 plate tests. The DNA G+C content of strains 8111 and 8201 were 65.8 and 65.5 mol%. Inoculation tests demonstrated that both strains 8111 and 8201 formed functional root nodules in their original host D. odorifera, and significantly enhanced plant growth (as measured by plant biomass and nitrogen content), compared to the no-inoculated control plants. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene in nodules of D. odorifera seedlings inoculated with strains 8111 and 8201 confirmed their identity. However, these two strains did not induce root nodulation in Acacia auriculiformis and Erythrophleum fordii. This implies that the nodulation capacity between Burkholderia strains 8111 or 8201 and their legume hosts may be specific. Our results show that both Burkholderia strains 8111 and 8201 are able to form functional nodules on D. odorifera and are potentially beneficial inoculants for seedling propagation to be used in large scale D. odorifera plantations.@@@Betaproteobacteria

Fruit and seed diameter increased linearly from DPA (Days Post Anthesis) 60 to DPA 150 and were stable thereafter. The weight of fruit and seed increased sigmoidally between DPA 100 and DPA 160. The water contents of whole seeds, axes and cotyledons had a sharp reduction from DPA 110 to DPA 130 but changed little after DPA 130. The water contents of whole seeds, axes and cotyledons were 1.42, 1.93 and 1.30 g g−1DW, respectively at the end of maturation. The starch content of cotyledons from mature seeds was high on a dry weight basis (31.4%) while the total soluble sugar content varied between 12 and 20%. In both axes and cotyledons, the total soluble sugar content decreased during the process of maturation, as did all five soluble sugar components measured (glucose, sucrose, trehalose, raffinose and stachyose). Sucrose and stachyose contents remained relatively high at the time of seed maturation, followed by glucose and a trace level of trehalose. The oligosaccharide/disaccharide (O/D) ratio in the axes was 3.1 at DPA 140. The high level of sucrose and stachyose might contribute to the greater desiccation tolerance of Aesculus chinensis seeds relative to typical recalcitrant tropical seeds. High levels of ABA content in seed coats and a low GA3/ABA ratio in both seed coats and axes might also influence the desiccation tolerance and shallow dormancy of mature Aesculus chinensis seeds.@@@Aesculus chinensis seeds

In this study, 534 samples representing 19 natural populations in India, China, Thailand and Myanmar were analyzed with 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The genetic diversity analysis revealed highly polymorphic loci (Na = 16.4), a good level of genetic diversity (Ho = 0.56; He = 0.83) and the deficiency of heterozygotes in G. arborea populations evidenced by positive fixation index and deviation from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium in all loci and most populations. The Analysis of Molecular Variance attributed 21, 10 and 69% of total genetic diversity to among-region, among-population (within region) and within-population variation. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean dendrogram and Principle Coordinate Analysis revealed three separate clusters composed of China, India and Thailand/Myanmar that were consistent with geographical distance and the presence of natural barriers to gene flow. Populations from within India grouped together genetically consistent with geographical locations, with the exception of the Nowgong population (eastern India), that might have originated from the Kasa area (western India) with which it has high genetic similarity. Understanding genetic diversity and structure of G. arborea populations serve as an important reference for tree breeding programs and conservation strategy. Breeding populations of G. arborea should include selections from each of the major geographic regions to maximize genetic diversity and heterosis. Vegetative propagated clones of elite trees can be used for plantation to address the issue of high level of segregation among seed derived plants.@@@SSR

Knowledge of genetic adaptation to environmental factors can help develop strategies for successful reforestation in arid terrain. In this study, Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) seedlings grown from seed collected from 40 open-pollinated families from five Balkan Peninsula provenances were evaluated for survival and growth under imposed drought. Within each provenance, seed was collected from an extremely harsh habitat and from a favorable habitat. One-year-old seedlings, from each provenance, habitat type and open pollinated family were transplanted into three “stressbeds”, each designed to simulate different levels of water availability by filling with varying ratios of crushed stone and soil. Seedling height growth and survival were recorded every 20–30 days from April–September. In all provenances, seedlings grown from seed originating from the harsh habitats had lower survival regardless of stressbed treatment compared to those grown from seed collected from favorable habitats, with the exception of one population from the Višegrad provenance which had high survival rates throughout. Overall height growth was very low and did not follow consistent patterns among treatment groups. Cluster analyses of survival data showed that populations from a similar habitat generally grouped together, regardless of provenance. The lowest and highest survival values were found in seedlings from harsh habitats, while those from the favorable habitats clustered in the mid-range. These results suggest that higher seed quality from productive stands may be the most influential factor determining seedling vigor under drought stress and that genetic adaptation to drought was not detected in adjacent populations having different habitat conditions.@@@Water deficit

Against this prospect, it is important not only to protect, but also to restore forest ecosystems. The paper analyzes the current and future role of the restoration of forests and degraded lands starting with the definition of various techniques, scales and objectives of forest restoration. Three key motivations for and targets of forest restoration are then discussed: forest biodiversity protection, biomass production, climate change mitigation and adaptation. The paper also briefly discusses three tools of increasing relevance for supporting forest restoration policies: the development of forest nursery techniques and the improvement of quality of forest reproductive material, the use of standard and certification tools, and financing of restoration investments, including projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. We conclude by making some final remarks on the future challenges of forest restoration policies.@@@Ecosystem services

The effect of plant provenance on plantation success is uncertain, although some previous studies suggest that some provenances may be better able to tolerate stress. We studied the tolerance to drought in seedlings from two Spanish provenances of Holm oak before and after outplanting. One provenance was from a continental climate with cold winters (GR) and the other was from a xeric climate (HU). Seedlings were subjected to a water stress test in the nursery during the summer and survival was visually assessed after 2 weeks. In addition, 35 healthy seedlings of each provenance that were not subjected to the water stress tests were used for outplanting experiment. In these plants the seasonal changes in water potential at dawn (Ψ), specific leaf area (SLA), cuticular transpiration (Ec), and loss of xylem hydraulic conductance of twigs (PLC) were measured over 18 months. After the water stress test in summer, mortality was 44.3 % for GR seedlings and 12.6 % for HU seedlings. In addition there were differences between the two provenances in plant water status after planting. The HU provenance had a better water status and was more water conservative in the summer (higher Ψ, lower Ec, lower PLC), but not in the winter. The different drought tolerance and water relations parameters of these two provenances indicate that provenance should be considered in forest restoration and conservation programs involving Holm oak.@@@Water stress

In this study we tested how different aspen seedling characteristics and planting times affect field outplanting performance on reclamation sites. We produced three different types of aspen planting stock, which varied significantly in seedling size, root-to-shoot ratio (RSR), and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves in roots, by artificially manipulating shoot growth during seedling production. All three stock types were then field-planted either in late summer, late fall, or early spring after frozen storage. Seedlings were outplanted onto two reclaimed open-pit mining areas in the boreal forest region of central and east-central Alberta, Canada, which varied significantly in latitude, reclamation history, and soil conditions. Overall, height growth was better in aspen stock types with high RSR and TNC reserves. Differences in field performance among aspen stock types appeared to be more strongly expressed when seedlings were exposed to more stressful environmental site conditions, such as low soil nutrients and moisture. Generally, aspen seedlings planted with leaves in the summer showed the poorest performance, and summer- or fall-planted seedlings with no shoot growth manipulation had much greater stem dieback after the first winter. This indicates that the dormancy and hardening of the stem, as a result of premature bud set treatments, could improve the outplanting performance of aspen seedlings, particularly those planted during summer and fall.@@@Growth and carbon allocation

"614","Deep planting with shelters improves performance of different stocktype sizes under arid Mediterranean conditions@@@@@@Received: 15 November 2011 Accepted: 06 May 2012 Published: 16 May 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@Increasing plant size has been considered a way to improve survival and growth of planted containerized stock under dry conditions. Additionally, deep planting provides advantages to seedlings in dry areas because roots are placed deeper into the soil where there is likely more water available. In this study, we tested the effect of Zizyphus lotus stock size (300, 400 and 1,000 cm3 container volume) and planting depth (0 cm and 15 cm below ground level, shallow and deep, respectively) with shelters in a factorial experiment in the arid coastal flats of Southeastern Spain. In the nursery, total biomass of Z. lotus produced in 1,000 cm3 container volume averaged 219 % of those grown in 300 and 400 cm3, although no significant differences were found in shoot-to-root ratio or nutrient status. Root growth potential (RGP) of plants produced in 1,000 cm3 container (209 mg of new roots dry mass) was significantly higher than those of the two other volumes (63 mg in average), but the ratio shoot mass:RGP did not vary significantly between container volumes. After outplanting, and during the first year, volumetric water content (12–20 cm deep from ground level) averaged 3.9 % higher around the deep- versus shallow- planted treatments. Predawn water potential (ψ pd) of seedlings measured in July of the first year differed significantly among planting depths, with lower values for shallow-planted (−3.3 MPa) than for deep-planted (−2.7 MPa) seedlings. However, predawn water potential did not differ among the three container sizes. Survival 40 months after planting was significantly higher for deep-planted seedlings (58.5 %) than for shallow ones (42.7 %), but no differences appeared for container size. PAR radiation at shoot height within the shelter was lower during winter for deep-planted seedlings than for shallow-planted seedlings, and relative differences among planting depths were reduced in summer. Based on survival results, we concluded that deep planting with seedlings of Z. lotus produced in 300 cm3 container is a very effective way to improve planting success under the arid conditions of our experiment.@@@Container size

Here we review the evidence of ground cover interactions with planted tree seedlings on coal surface mines of the eastern US, discuss recent research into these interactions, and draw conclusions concerning ground cover management when restoring forests on reclaimed coal mines. Reclaimed mine sites have a high potential to support productive forests, however forest establishment is inhibited by reclamation practices that included soil compaction, and the seeding of competitive ground covers. In the first few years after tree planting, a dense ground cover of grass and legume species commonly seeded on mine sites often affect growth and survival negatively. Herbaceous vegetation providing less extensive and competitive ground coverage may either facilitate or inhibit tree establishment, depending on site conditions. The use of quality planting stock promotes the competitive ability of seedlings by improving nutrient status and the ability to capture available resources. Herbaceous species have contrasting functional characteristics, and thus compete differently with trees for available resources. Negative interactions with trees are more frequently reported for non-native cool-season grasses than for native warm-season grasses, while the effects of legumes change over time. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of tree/ground cover interactions. The development of seeding mixes that can control erosion, facilitate survival and growth of planted trees, and allow establishment by unplanted native species would aid forest restoration on eastern US, coal mines.@@@Hardwoods

"616","Promoting seedling stress resistance through nursery techniques in China@@@@@@Received: 05 October 2011 Accepted: 02 May 2012 Published: 16 May 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@Plantation forestry is one of the most important approaches to restoring forest cover in China. Of the remaining sites suitable for afforestation in China, 52 % are considered harsh and only 13 % considered good, which indicates that successfully establishing a plantation in the future will become more and more difficult. Seedling quality in terms of morphology, physiology, and viability is a critical aspect for successful plantation establishment. Due to a large area in need of afforestation, and because of its diverse harsh sites, many studies have focused on nursery techniques of promoting seedling stress resistance, including inoculating ectomycorrhizal fungi, applying plant growth regulators, use of fall fertilization, induced water stresses, or a combined use of these methods. Most of relevant results of this research have been published in Chinese, and are unknown to researchers from other countries. Moreover, no comprehensive review of stress resistance research in forest tree seedlings in China has been completed. Therefore, this review intends to provide a concise synthesis of literature related to plant manipulation techniques that offer seedling stress resistance in Chinese nurseries, discuss potential shortcomings of these studies, and define priorities for future seedling stress resistance research. With this paper we hope to enhance communication about nursery and plantation seedling culture among researchers from China and other countries.@@@Forest tree seedling

The method is effective because it does not require the development of structured pedigree or classical progeny testing, rather it uses DNA fingerprinting to determine the genealogical relationship among individuals. The resulting genetic network is known as the realized relationship matrix, which in turn is used in classical quantitative genetics analyses to determine the genetic worth of all fingerprinted individuals. Selection of desirable individuals among the surviving population is aimed at maximizing genetic diversity even when the original genetic source is unknown. This is accomplished by determining the number of founder genome equivalents which can be used to estimate the inbreeding effective population size. During the selection phase, genetic diversity can be balanced against genetic gain so that diversity is maximized while gain for any particular attribute is optimized.@@@GBLUP

We studied eighteen 300 m2 plots in which 1 year-old seedlings had been planted after subsoiling on the contour. Plots were stratified according to aspect (north and south) and previous land use/parent material: shrubland on limestone (LM-SH), shrubland on gypsum rock (GY-SH), and cropland on colluvium (CO-AG). Soils developed on limestone and colluvium had average rooting depths of 27 and 37 cm, respectively, and mean concentrations of active lime and phosphorus (P) of 130 and 190 mg g−1 and 10 and 19 mg kg−1, respectively. Soils developed on gypsum had a mean rooting depth of 26 cm, and a mean gypsum concentration of 73 %. Height and diameter of trees varied significantly according to parent material/previous land use but not to slope aspect. Mean height and diameter of trees were significantly higher in CO-AG plots than in LM-SH and GY-SH plots. Soil P and depth were the main variables explaining differences in dominant height across all 18 plots. In CO-AG plots mean height was negatively related to soil pH but positively related to soil P concentration. In LM-SH plots, mean diameter and height were negatively related to active lime concentration. This study suggests that soil P is a major determinant of holm oak performance in shallow calcareous soils and highlights the importance of conducting detailed soil studies in order to assess the viability of plantations with this species.@@@Active lime

One important aspect of a successful forest restoration program is planting quality seedlings with high survival capability. Thus the nursery needs to create seedlings with plant attributes that allow for the best chance of success once a seedling is field planted. Since the mid-twentieth century, research foresters have critically examined plant attributes that confer improved seedling survival to field site conditions. This review describes the value of commonly measured seedling quality material (i.e. shoot height, stem diameter, root mass, shoot to root ratio, drought resistance, mineral nutrient status) and performance (i.e. freezing tolerance and root growth) plant attributes defined as important in answering the question of why seedlings survive after planting. Desirable levels of these plant attributes can increase the speed with which seedlings overcome planting stress, become ‘coupled’ to the forest restoration site, thereby ensuring successful seedling establishment. Although planting seedlings with these desirable plant attributes does not guarantee high survival rates; planting seedlings with desirable plant attributes increases chances for survival after field planting.@@@Seedling survival

With that purpose, we designed a cross-sectional study to examine the effects of topographic position, gravel surface cover and accompanying vegetation cover on holm oak plantations density, growth (height and basal diameter) and health status. We surveyed three technically identical and multi-patched holm oak plantations dating from 1995, 1998 and 2003, aged 15, 12 and 7 respectively, covering an homogeneous climate and soil area of about 500 ha located in Central-Western Spain. Six hundred and seventy-two pruned and unpruned trees were sampled in 107 systematically sampled plots covering a wide range of site conditions in the studied area. At the tree level, two linear mixed effect models were adjusted for each year under study to explore the influence of pruning and microsite factors on height and diameter. Also at a tree level, a linear mixed effect model was fitted in order to analyze the influence of microsite factors and pruning on the health status of trees. At plot level, we performed a Multifactor Analysis of variance model to explore the influence of the microsite predictor variables and of the age of plantations on stocking. The results revealed that both basal diameter and height were increased by early pruning in all plantations under study. The effects on height and basal diameter of the three microsite parameters analysed varied with the age of plantations. The oldest plantations (15 years old), were affected by the surface gravel cover, while vegetation cover was significant in 12 years old plantations. Slope position was near relevant (p < 0.1) only in the youngest plantations. When significant, a high surface gravel cover was directly related to higher trees and larger basal diameters. Plantations density was significantly affected by the topographic position and, in all the plantations studied, pruned trees were associated with a better health status. Overall, our results show that early pruning and microsite conditions significantly influence the growth of holm oak seedlings. These results suggest that the management and growth modelling of holm oak should take into consideration the spatial distribution of the different microsites represented. Moreover, early- pruning should be considered as a positive practice affecting not only final tree form but also the growth and health status of trees. Finally, our results should lead to for further studies and help for improving future projects in areas with similar conditions.@@@Holm oak

This evaluative tool has been measured routinely using foliage on conifer seedlings to assess seedling physiological status during winter dormancy. Absence of foliage during dormancy has thus far precluded the potential application of CF to seedling quality assessment of temperate deciduous hardwood seedlings. Because stems contain chlorophyll, however, assessment of CF using stem tissue may serve as an effective alternative tissue type to facilitate CF measurements. We collected Juglans nigra L. (black walnut) seed from two provenances (Alabama and Indiana, USA) and subjected 1-year-old container seedlings from these provenances to a simulated hardening regime (i.e., progressively decreasing temperatures and photoperiods) in a growth chamber environment over an 18-week period; CF of stem tissue (evaluated as ΦPSII, efficiency of photosystem II) was sampled periodically at seven time intervals. Though both provenance and measurement period significantly affected ΦPSII, measurement period had a much more pronounced effect. Values for ΦPSII fluctuated (ranging from 0.45 to 0.72) during the simulated growth and hardening regimes, generally decreasing over time for both provenances. Our results suggest that physiological status of temperate deciduous seedlings may be effectively evaluated during dormancy by assessing CF of stem tissue.@@@Black walnut

In the current study, we evaluated shoot growth, rooting ability and mini-cuttings production of P. pinaster in response to nitrogen fertilization and seasons. We compared eight half-sib families of P. pinaster from Asturias and Galicia (Northern Iberian Peninsula), searching for useful parameters and growing conditions to be included in a mass propagation program for clonal family forestry. We fertilized P. pinaster seedling mother plants kept in a greenhouse with three levels of nitrogen: high (HN), medium (MN) and low (LN) to evaluate rooting ability of mini-cuttings. In addition, we evaluated the maximal potential production of rooted mini-cuttings considering nine cycles of propagation over 1 year, also using three levels of nitrogen. The HN treatment significantly influenced the rooting process, with length, area and volume of roots all being positively affected. Spring was the most favourable season for mini-cuttings in the HN treatment. This study provides valuable new information to optimize the clonal propagation protocol for P. pinaster and shows that the mini-cuttings technique has great potential in mass scale cloning, providing high quality sprout production and well-formed new plants.@@@Maritime pine

Low seedling survival and growth may result in restoration failures and various mechanical site preparation techniques for treatment of soils and vegetation are important tools used to help counteract this. In this article, we synthesize the current state-of-knowledge concerning mechanical site preparation for improved tree establishment when carried out in different forest restoration situations, point out critical research gaps and provide some recommendations for future directions. Mechanical site preparation often results in improved seedling survival and growth. However, if not intensive methods with much soil disturbance are used, it is a rather ineffective tool for controlling competing vegetation. Methods such as scarification, mounding and subsoiling also lead to multiple interactions among soil physical and chemical properties that affect plant survival and growth, and it may be difficult to determine the actual cause–effect relationship of any positive seedling responses. Most research to date on mechanical site preparation and plantation performance has been conducted using a few conifer tree species. Seedling responses differ among tree species and alternative species are often used during restoration compared to production forestry indicating a need for additional research for improved understanding. Several management objectives such as soil protection and increased biodiversity are many times relevant during forest restoration, and mechanical site preparation methods should be implemented carefully because they can have large impacts on the environment.@@@Afforestation

We examined hardwood seedling survival and growth in an outdoor laboratory where the timing, depth, duration, and flow rate of flood water can be carefully controlled while simulating natural soil conditions occurring in floodplains. Flooding treatments were initiated in mid-May and included partial inundation (15–20 cm) during the growing season for 5-week flowing, 5-week standing, 3-week flowing, and control. We monitored the vigor, survival, and growth (changes in basal diameter and stem length) of six hardwood species representing a wide range in expected flood tolerance including eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. Ex Marsh.), pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), and pecan [Carya illinoensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch]. All stock was 1-0 bareroot except that cuttings were used for eastern cottonwood. Five species—eastern cottonwood, bur oak, swamp white oak, pin oak, and pecan—exhibited high survival probabilities (>0.62 for cottonwood; >0.77 for the others) regardless of flood treatment. But of the survivors, only eastern cottonwood and swamp white oak maintained positive growth and healthy green foliage. Despite high survival, bur oak and pin oak suffered stem growth losses and exhibited chlorotic foliage in flood treatments suggesting greater vulnerability to other abiotic or biotic stresses if outplanted on flood-prone sites. Pecan also suffered stem dieback in controls suggesting vulnerability to competition and browsing when outplanted despite high survival after flooding. Our quantitative data helps to confirm and/or refine previously published qualitative flood tolerance ratings for these species, and describes operation of an in situ outdoor flood experiment laboratory that may prove effective in guiding future flood tolerance research.@@@Flood tolerance

Although they are dominant in mixed species forests and widely distributed, there are frequent reports of regeneration failures. An adequate population of large oak advance reproduction is a critical prerequisite to successful oak regeneration, and hence sustainability of oak. But, many oak forests lack sufficient density of large and competitive oak advance reproduction. Artificial regeneration of oak by underplanting is done to supplement natural populations of oak seedlings or to introduce oak in stands where it is missing. Planting high quality seedlings is important. Silvicultural practices that regulate stand density such as thinning and the shelterwood method are needed to increase oak’s regeneration potential by promoting accumulation and growth of natural and planted seedlings before the final regeneration harvest. Control of competing vegetation and herbivory are important elements in the regeneration prescription. Light in the understory is a limiting factor to the accumulation of large oak advance reproduction. Light levels (20–50 % +) sufficient for biomass production in oak reproduction result through management of stand density and other competing vegetation. We review and synthesize the literature on silvicultural approaches to using artificial regeneration to obtain successful oak regeneration that is grounded in fundamental principles of oak biology and ecology. Principles of oak regeneration presented here may also have relevance to other hydric, mesic and dry-mesic forest environments.@@@Quercus

This shift in land-use has released large areas that are now dominated by early-successional forests with limited mid- and late-successional species regeneration. Enrichment underplanting, with the partial preservation of the existing vegetation to serve as a shelterwood, has been proposed to restore the production of valuable timber. The present study reports mid-term (8–12 year) results from an enrichment planting experiment located at two sites in the St-Lawrence River Valley, eastern Canada. The objective was to identify the required frequency of low-intensity thinnings necessary to secure an optimal density of promising stems of black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Partial thinning treatments were applied during the 3rd and 7th growing seasons and compared to a single thinning applied at the 7th year. Each thinning treatment increased available light to 20–30 % in the understory (measured the following year at 2 m from ground level). The height of red oaks released twice was almost double that of red oaks thinned only once. The effect on black cherry was less dramatic and significant only at one of the two sites. A higher intensity or an earlier application of thinning regimes may be required for black cherry. The early thinning allowed a larger number of planted trees to react positively to the second thinning. The practice of double thinning over a period of 12 years allowed for the production of a significant number of competitively successful trees for the landowner.@@@Underplanting

Insights from an ecophysiological conceptual model of plant survival@@@@@@Received: 28 November 2011 Accepted: 05 April 2012 Published: 24 April 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@Reduction in size and tissue nutrient concentration is widely considered to increase seedling drought resistance in dry and oligotrophic plantation sites. However, much evidence indicates that increase in size and tissue nutrient concentration improves seedling survival in Mediterranean forest plantations. This suggests that the ecophysiological processes and functional attributes relevant for early seedling survival in Mediterranean climate must be reconsidered. We propose a ecophysiological conceptual model for seedling survival in Mediterranean-climate plantations to provide a physiological explanation of the frequent positive relationship between outplanting performance and seedling size and nutrient concentration. The model considers the physiological processes outlined in the plantation establishment model of Burdett (Can J For Res 20:415–427, 1990), but incorporates other physiological processes that drive seedling survival, such as N remobilization, carbohydrate storage and plant hydraulics. The model considers that seedling survival in Mediterranean climates is linked to high growth capacity during the wet season. The model is for container plants and is based on three main principles, (1) Mediterranean climates are not dry the entire year but usually have two seasons of contrasting water availability; (2) summer drought is the main cause of seedling mortality; in this context, deep and large roots is a key trait for avoiding lethal water stress; (3) attainment of large root systems in the dry season is promoted when seedlings have high growth during the wet season. High growth is achieved when seedlings can divert large amount of resources to support new root and shoot growth. Functional traits that confer high photosynthesis, nutrient remobilization capacity, and non-structural carbohydrate storage promote high growth. Increases in seedling size and nutrient concentration strongly affect these physiological processes. Traits that confer high drought resistance are of low value during the wet season because hinder growth capacity. We provide specific evidence to support the model and finally we discuss its implications and the factors that may alter the frequent increase in performance with increase in seedling size and tissue nutrient concentration.@@@Carbohydrates

In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, salvage logging is considered a measure to reduce future reforestation costs, but this assumption remains largely untested. We made a cost analysis of different management schemes, addressing the immediate post-fire burnt-wood management as well as the costs and success of subsequent reforestation efforts. Two experimental 25-ha plots were established in a burnt pine reforestation of SE Spain, in which three replicates of three post-fire treatments were applied: non-intervention (NI), partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping off the branches from most of the trees, leaving all biomass in situ), and salvage logging (SL). After 4 years, a mechanised reforestation was undertaken, and seedling mortality was monitored for 2 years. The cost of all management operations was recorded in situ, and the cost of re-planting the dead seedlings was estimated according to the expenses of previous reforestation. Initial cost of wood management was greatest in SL and zero in NI. Reforestation cost was highest in NI and lowest in SL, and seedling-mortality rates proved lowest in PCL (43 % vs. 51 % and 52 % in SL and NI, respectively). Considering all the post-fire management operations, salvage logging did not provide particular economic advantages for forest restoration, and had an overall cost of 3,436 ± 340 €/ha. By contrast, NI and PCL reduced total restoration costs by 50 and 35 %, respectively, and PCL indeed promoted restoration success. We suggest that the full cost of management operations needs to be considered when evaluating the economic implications of post-fire salvage logging.@@@Forest economics

Controlled release fertilizer (CRF) applied at planting may reduce transplant stress by augmenting rhizosphere nutrient availability yet with potential risk of root system damage due to elevated fertilizer salt concentrations, which may be further exacerbated by drought. Under controlled conditions, we examined northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) leaf physiological parameters and soluble sugar concentrations in response to varying nutrient levels (via CRF application) and moisture availability gradients ranging from drought to flooding. Net photosynthetic rates, transpiration rates, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters responded positively to CRF application, and no interactions were observed between CRF and moisture availability; however, CRF did not increase soluble sugar concentrations. No effects of short-term drought were observed, but flooding exerted a rapid negative influence on net photosynthetic rates, transpiration rates, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters; flooding also elevated soluble sugar concentrations, indicative of disrupted carbon partitioning and a much greater sensitivity to root-zone hypoxia than to drought in this species. Lack of interactions between CRF application and soil moisture availability indicates relatively similar responses of fertilized seedlings across moisture gradients.@@@Flooding

Land degradation in drylands (e.g. desertification) usually reduces soil productivity and, especially, soil water availability. In dry sub-humid regions, forest fires constitute a major disturbance affecting ecosystem dynamics and reforestation planning. Climate change projections indicate an increase of drought and more severe fire regime in many dryland regions of the world. In this context, the main target of plantation technology development is to overcome transplant shock and likely adverse periods, and in drylands this is mostly related to water limitations. In this paper, we discuss some selected steps that we consider critical for improving success in outplanting woody plants, both under current and projected climate change conditions including: (1) Plant species selection, (2) Improved nursery techniques, and (3) Improved planting techniques. The number of plant species used in reforestation is increasing rapidly, moving from a reduced set of well-known, easy-to-grow, widely used species, to a large variety of promising native species. Available technologies allow for reintroducing native plants and recovering critical ecosystem functions for many degraded drylands. However, climate change projections introduce large uncertainties about the sustainability of current reforestation practices. To cope with these uncertainties, adaptive restoration approaches are suggested, on the basis of improved plant quality, improved techniques for optimizing rain use efficiency in plantations, and exploring native plant species, including provenances and genotypes, for their resilience to fire and water use efficiency.@@@Mediterranean ecosystems

However, competitive interactions can impair the successful establishment of forest plantations, especially in the presence of ericaceous species, such as Kalmia angustifolia, that are good competitors for soil resources. We used data from a silvicultural trial established in northwestern Quebec (Canada) to test the hypothesis that Kalmia’s effect on seedling growth is an asymptotic nonlinear function of proximity to Kalmia at time of planting. Our main objective was to derive species-specific thresholds of Kalmia-proximity tolerance at the time of planting for boreal sites prone to Kalmia invasion following harvesting. Using nonlinear quantile regressions (90th percentile), height, diameter and growth of planted Picea mariana and Pinus banksiana seedlings over 8 years was regressed against the initial distance to the nearest Kalmia stem at time of planting. We also investigated the relation between annual growth and the distance to nearest Kalmia stem during any given year between age 2 and 8-years. Finally, we evaluated how mechanical soil scarification influenced Kalmia recovery over time by looking at its rate of spread, estimated from mean distance to planted seedlings over 8 years. Silvicultural treatments increased the intercepts and asymptotes of all variables for Pinus. However, asymptotic values for Picea could not be identified, thus precluding threshold assessment for initial distance to Kalmia at planting for this species. For Pinus planted on scarified sites, a Kalmia-free radius of 60 cm would lead to ~80 to 85 % of the 90th percentile of maximum potential height at age 8 years. Mechanical scarification created Kalmia-free microsites that were rapidly re-invaded by spread of Kalmia; planting immediately following soil preparation of these sites is therefore important for ensuring successful plantation establishment.@@@Reforestation

The most effective defense strategy is biological control, but parasitoid effectiveness requires at least 6–10 years to reduce damage to acceptable levels. In Italy, prolonged productivity losses could adversely affect human activity in chestnut orchard stands, resulting in negative socio-economic and hydrogeologic consequences. Thus, it is necessary to quickly reduce the impacts of the infestation to avoid degradation of chestnut stands during the time delay required for parasitoid efficiency. We examined green pruning as a means to reduce negative impacts of gall wasps and stimulate healthy shoots in a young chestnut coppice in Central Italy. Two different pruning cuts (Long- and Short-cut) on growing shoots and four timings of application were tested. The development and phytosanitary status of nodes was observed over 2 years on pruned and control sprouts. Pruning was effective in reducing gall wasp damage though responses varied among pruning techniques and application times. Long-cut pruning made in spring during the full growth phase induced a higher number of new and better-developed shoots. Pruning during the end of the egg-laying period of the gall wasps promoted development of only healthy new shoots. Our results indicate that is possible, by choosing the best combination of time and technique, to identify a pruning method useful to maintain growth and development of C. sativa stands threatened by D. kuriphilus.@@@Chestnut

"633","Determining suitable locations for seed transfer under climate change: a global quantitative method@@@@@@Received: 02 November 2011 Accepted: 22 March 2012 Published: 05 April 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@Changing climate conditions will complicate efforts to match seed sources with the environments to which they are best adapted. Tree species distributions may have to shift to match new environmental conditions, potentially requiring the establishment of some species entirely outside of their current distributions to thrive. Even within the portions of tree species ranges that remain generally suitable for the species, local populations may not be well-adapted to altered local conditions. To assist efforts to restore forests and to maximize forest productivity in the face of climate change, we developed a set of 30,000 quantitatively defined seed transfer “ecoregions” across the globe. Reflecting current and future conditions, these were created by combining global maps of potentially important environmental characteristics using a large-scale statistical clustering technique. This approach assigns every 4 km2 terrestrial raster cell into an ecoregion using non-hierarchical clustering of the cells in multivariate space based on 16 environmental variables. Two cells anywhere on the map with similar combinations of environmental characteristics are located near each other in this data space; cells are then classified into relatively homogeneous ecoregion clusters. Using two global circulation models and two emissions scenarios, we next mapped the predicted environmentally equivalent future locations of each ecoregion in 2050 and 2100. We further depicted areas of decreasing environmental similarity to given ecoregions, both in current time and under climate change. This approach could help minimize the risk that trees used for production, restoration, reforestation, and afforestation are maladapted to their planting sites.@@@Restoration

"634","A review of ecophysiologically-based seedling specifications for temperate Australian eucalypt plantations@@@@@@Received: 31 October 2011 Accepted: 19 March 2012 Published: 04 April 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@The Australian hardwood plantation estate has significantly expanded in the last decade. Key production issues included: (1) will Eucalyptus nitens Maiden seedlings produced in nurseries on relatively mild sites be susceptible to transplant shock and browsing on cold out-planting sites and can this be managed? And; (2) what specifications should be required of nursery producers for Eucalyptus globulus Labill seedlings for out-planting on mild ex-pasture sites? This review outlines the research conducted in order to address these key questions. Nitrogen deprivation in the nursery induced accumulation of foliar anthocyanin which conferred hardiness to low temperature. Target specifications of 8–10 g/kg foliar nitrogen are recommended. Height of >120 mm, root collar diameter >2.8 mm, seedling container volume of ≥85 cm3, depth of ≥73 mm, density of ≥549 cells/m2 and foliar nitrogen concentration of 15–20 g/kg were found to be key specifications for optimal E. globulus growth following planting onto mild ex-pasture sites. Exponential nutrient loading was a useful technique for attaining target foliar N concentrations. Seedling size was found not to affect growth of E. globulus post-planting on mild ex-pasture sites. However, large seedlings were preferentially browsed on high vertebrate-browse-pressure sites in Tasmania (poisons are banned and shooting is not effective on some sites) that did not affect subsequent growth rate but did increase the incidence of double-leaders. The ‘target seedling concept’ is applicable to eucalypts for Australian planting sites: specifications attained in the nursery should be matched to the factors limiting growth on the planting sites.@@@Anthocyanin

For seedlings to be able to survive in storage it is crucial that they store well and can cope with the dark and cold storage environment. The aim of this study was to search for genes that can determine the vitality status of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings during frozen storage. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the ColdNSure™ test, a gene activity test that predicts storability was assessed. The storability of seedlings was tested biweekly by evaluating damage with the gene activity test and the electrolyte leakage test after freezing seedlings to −25 °C (the SELdiff-25 method). In parallel, seedlings were frozen stored at −3 °C. According to both methods, seedlings were considered storable from week 41. This also corresponded to the post storage results determined at the end of the storage period. In order to identify vitality indicators, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on bud samples collected during storage. Comparing physiological post storage data to gene analysis data revealed numerous vitality related genes. To validate the results, a second trial was performed. In this trial, gene activity was better in predicting seedling storability than the conventional freezing test; this indicates a high sensitivity level of this molecular assay. For multiple indicators a clear switch between damaged and vital seedlings was observed. A collection of indicators will be used in the future development of a commercial vitality test.@@@Vitality test

"636","Economically profitable post fire restoration with black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) producing plantations@@@@@@Received: 23 September 2011 Accepted: 07 March 2012 Published: 18 March 2012 Issue Date: September 2012@@@Cultivating black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is highly profitable in sites suitable for its development. Land use history is an important factor when choosing suitable habitat, and lands with non-ectomycorrhizal host species are recommended when introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in order to reduce competition from native, soil-borne ectomycorrhizal (ECM) inoculum. Nearly every year Mediterranean wildfires cause the loss of forested lands where soil and climatic characteristics are suitable for truffle cultivation. Introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in these sites could promote reforestation with a native ECM fungus and, in addition, may provide economic incentives. We tested the viability of burnt forest lands for truffle cultivation by introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated Quercus ilex seedlings in burnt forest sites with and without resprouting forest species which act as repositories for native ECM fungi. We also evaluated the role of the ECM host plants, which resprout after a forest fire, in the maintenance and dynamic processes of the ECM fungal community. The study followed a factorial design with two levels: (1) T. melanosporum-inoculated and non-inoculated Q. ilex seedlings and (2) presence and absence of ECM host plants resprouting after the fire. We established 10 experimental plots with 360 holm oaks. After four and a half years, the truffle-inoculated holm oaks maintained 36 % of their root tips colonized with T. melanosporum, and 10 years after plantations, 26.2 % of the surviving inoculated holm oaks displayed a “truffle burn” area. A greater ECM morphotype richness was associated with seedlings planted in plots with the presence of ECM host plants, whereas the T. melanosporum mycorrhizal ratio was constant. These results suggest that reforestation with T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings can be successful following forest fires and highlights the competitiveness of this fungus within the ECM community in these soils.@@@Forest fire

"650","Susceptibility of provenances and families of Pinus maximinoi and Pinus tecunumanii to frost in South Africa@@@@@@Received: 15 April 2011 Accepted: 14 January 2012 Published: 28 January 2012 Issue Date: January 2013@@@The future of South Africa’s most important pine species, Pinus patula, is threatened by the pitch canker fungus, Fusarium circinatum. Pinus maximinoi and P. tecunumanii represent two subtropical species that provide an alternative to planting P. patula on the warmer sites of South Africa. Extending the planting range of P. tecunumanii and P. maximinoi to include higher and colder altitude sites will reduce the area planted to P. patula and the risk of F. circinatum. During 2007 progeny trials of P. tecunumanii and P. maximinoi were planted on a sub-tropical and sub-temperate site. Shortly after the establishment of these trials, unusually cold weather conditions were experienced across South Africa (−3°C at the sub-temperate site) resulting in severe mortality. This provided the opportunity to assess the variation in survival as a measure of frost tolerance within these two species to determine whether it could be improved upon through selection. Results indicated that the variation in survival was under genetic control in P. tecunumanii (h 2(0,1) = 0.16, h 2L = 0.27) and P. maximinoi (h 2(0,1) = 0.11, h 2L = 0.23) at the sub-temperate site. Correlations in provenance ranking for survival across sites were high for both species. Moderate correlations in family survival for P. tecunumanii (r = 0.52) were found at the two sites. Improvements in cold tolerance can thus be made in both species extending their planting range to include greater areas planted to P. patula thereby limiting the risk of F. circinatum.@@@Camcore

Understanding the physiological mechanisms that relate water use and frost resistance for highly deployed genotypes may allow for better prediction of their future performance, genetic selection and seedling management for site specific purposes. We studied whether instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE i ) may serve as drought, freezing and photoinhibition tolerance predictor by studying its response on six E. globulus clones (Eg1–Eg6) and four E. globulus × E. nitens hybrid seedlings (Egn1–Egn4) under drought and irrigated (control) treatments. Net photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) were studied using a gas exchange system in order to calculate WUE i (A/E). Simultaneous chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were performed to assess the non photochemical quenching components. Frost tolerance of plants under control and drought treatments were evaluated by measuring temperatures that exert 50% photoinactivation of photosystem II. Finally, drought tolerance was evaluated by plant survival within each genotype after rehydration. Our results showed significant genotype variability in the rate of soil and xylem water potential decrease during drought. While most of the genotypes reached −4.0 MPa in about 35 days of drought, genotypes Eg6 and Egn4 required 56 days of drought to reach this xylem water potential. WUE i exhibited significant differences among genotypes and irrigation treatments. Genotypes Eg5 and Egn4 increased their WUE i between 70 and 80% after drought. This was associated with a more conservative control of water loss at the stomatal level combined with maintenance of relatively higher rates of net photosynthesis than the other genotypes under drought conditions. Plants exposed to drought were more freezing tolerant than control plants, having in average 3°C lower LT50 than well irrigated ones. There was no a clear correlation between WUE i and drought tolerance or drought-induced photoinhibition, however WUE i was inversely correlated with LT50. Our results suggest that WUE i is not suitable by itself to select drought tolerant genotypes, but may provide evidence for discarding drought sensitive genotypes. In addition, it could provide valuable information to select for freezing tolerance.@@@Frost

As a result of increasing costs and environmental incentives, seedling-growers are seeking more local growing medium components such as composts. Composts are, however, diverse products with varying chemical, physical, and hygienic properties and therefore require thorough testing before real-world use. In this study, a commonly used compost (raw materials: sewage sludge, biowaste, peat, wood chips) was tested for feasibility as a component (0–30 vol.%) of a sphagnum peat container medium for growing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) container seedlings in a forest-tree nursery. In proportions of up to 30% in peat, the compost additive used was shown to be a feasible material for seedling growing in forest nurseries. On average, the seedlings grew best in pure peat, but the compost additions to peat showed no marked reduction in seedling growth in greenhouses, nor were there any effect on seedling growth in the first summer after outplanting. However, a slightly elevated risk of seed non-germination and of seedling mortality was observed when the growing media contained compost in proportions of 20% or more. The compost additive in peat also changed the bulk density, structure, and chemical properties of the medium during nursery growing. The results suggest that seedling watering and fertilisation should be adjusted for each growing medium mix separately to achieve correct water, oxygen, and nutrient availability in containers during nursery growing.@@@Forest nursery

We evaluated the association of mahogany with soil characteristics using the easily observed characteristics of soil color, stoniness, and relief position. The study was conducted in a commercially managed, medium-height, semi-evergreen, dry tropical forest. A total of 609 mahogany were located along 119 km of transects established in the forest. Forest site conditions were classified in 2,464, 0.78 m2 circular plots located systematically along transects, and site conditions of mahogany along the transects were recorded for the area within 1 m radius of each tree. Mahogany preferred level sites with 93% occurring on level conditions compared to 75% for forest site plots (P < 0.001). There was also a preference for black soils (76% of mahogany versus 68% of forest site plots) and a negative preference for red soils (17% versus 27%, P < 0.001). Observed soil site preferences can improve management decisions, including where to plant mahogany and where to apply silvicultural treatments, such as liberation thinning.@@@Maya forest

A total of seven hybrid trials were established at four sites, representative of low to medium rainfall. The female parents were from E. grandis preselected for superior volume production. No pure species were included in the trials to act as controls and allow for estimation of hybrid vigour. Survival, growth and stem straightness were assessed at 18 and 43 months from planting. Survival was generally above 80% for all hybrids across sites. G × C hybrids performed better than G × T hybrids, showing a 20% difference in mean height at 43 months. Female and male variances were generally insignificant (P > 0.05) and in some cases, the estimates were 0. This was not unexpected, as the parents for the hybrids were preselected for superior height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and volume production as pure species. Ratio of dominance to phenotypic variance (\( \hat{d}^{2} \)) was significant for all traits for all hybrids (P < 0.05). Trait–trait dominance correlations (r D ) at 43 months between height and DBH were generally large and positive, above 0.6. Type-B dominance correlation (r BD ) suggested evidence of genotype-by-environment interaction (G × E), but one high elevation site contributed most to the observed G × E. If these results are confirmed in larger mating designs with progeny established on multiple sites, it seems that the most appropriate breeding strategy for E. grandis × E. tereticornis and E. grandis × E. camaldulensis hybrids may be one that exploits both additive and dominance genetic variance, such as the reciprocal recurrent selection (RRS) scheme or RRS with forward selection.@@@Growth traits

Because stress tolerance is mediated by an array of overlapping defense mechanisms, we hypothesized that P. euphratica would confer co-tolerance to heavy metal stress. To test this hypothesis, both poplar species were exposed to 50 μM Cd for 24 h in hydroponic solutions. For the analyses of stress symptoms in roots and leaves, we used nutrient element concentrations and transcriptional responses of 28 stress- and defense-related genes. The roots showed strong Cd accumulation, but less in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens. In contrast, the leaves of P. euphratica accumulated 10-times more Cd than those of P. × canescens. Cd-stressed leaves of P. euphratica displayed water loss and wilting. Both species revealed contrasting transcriptional responses of defense genes to Cd stress. In P. euphratica, glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione S-transferases of the theta and tau classes showed increases in transcript levels in response to Cd, pointing to oxidative stress and a strong activation of detoxification mechanisms. In contrast, in P. × canescens transcript levels of genes involved in signaling, activation of, and protection from drought stress were significantly increased including glutathione S-transferases of the phi class (early response to dehydration). Our data show that P. euphratica salt tolerance does not confer Cd tolerance and suggest that failure to activate early protection contributed to higher Cd sensitivity in P. euphratica than in P. × canescens.@@@Drought

The species is valued for its timber, as well as for wildlife and recreation. Regeneration of this species is somewhat unpredictable and often occurs in patches of similarly-aged cohorts. We described the regeneration patterns of this species and examined their relation to environmental variables within hardwood forests of southwestern Virginia, USA. An average of 5.3 white pine patches per ha were observed in this study. The majority of patches consisted of saplings (85%), with 9% of patches in pole size classes, and 6% in seedling size classes. The average density of patches was 43.5 stems with an average age of 20 years. The size of patches averaged 80.6 m2. The total density of seedlings and the number of regeneration patches of all sizes of regeneration (seedlings, saplings, and poles) in plots was related to the surrounding density of large white pine trees (potential seed trees). The density of seedlings or patches was not significantly related to current vegetation cover or soil surface cover variables, but more than half of regeneration patches were located in or adjacent to old canopy gaps, most of which were old logging gaps. While seedling regeneration may occur within the understory of these forests near seed trees, advancement to the sapling and pole stage appears to be associated with canopy gap formation.@@@Natural regeneration

Stump sprout survival rate, number of sprouts, and sprout height under the three partial harvests during the first year post-harvest did not differ. Six years post-harvest, 78.32% of the stumps had living sprouts. No variation in sprout survival was found among the treatments throughout the study period. The number of living sprouts per stump was 13.77 ± 0.50 in the first growing season after harvest, and dropped to 6.49 ± 0.22 after 6 years. This result indicated the occurrence of self-thinning within the sprout clumps. Moreover, the height of dominant sprout increased from 52.88 ± 1.62 cm (in the first year) to 132.82 ± 2.35 cm (in the sixth year) post-harvest. Sprout height in the leave-tree harvest type was higher than those in the two shelterwoods in the fifth and sixth years after logging. Annual height growth was approximately 8–96 cm during the first growing season, and then decreased at a rate of 1–44 cm per year in the following years. A negative relationship was found between sprout height and the number of sprouts per stump. This result indicated a trade-off between the number of sprouts and height growth. The number of sprouts per stump decreased by about 0.2 stem for each 1 m2/ha increased in residual basal area. Therefore, sprouting may play an important role in the restoration of the secondary forest after harvesting.@@@Quercus liaotungensis Koidz

Seed dormancy is the putative cause for delayed and sporadic germination of teak seed but specific dormancy mechanisms have not been proven. In this paper we investigate whether physical or mechanical dormancy could affect teak germination. Physical dormancy was disproved when we observed water in every examined locule of fruit which had been immersed for 12–24 h (n = 1,700 fruits from six diverse sources). Mechanical dormancy was found to affect teak seed germination by means of valve structures which must open for the radicle to emerge. All 1,450 germinating seeds in 16 samples emerged from the endocarp via the detachment of a valve. Germination over 16 days was compared between extracted seeds (ex situ) and seeds within their endocarp (in situ) to determine the effect of mechanical dormancy on germination. Significantly greater germination of the ex situ seeds (62 ± 2% SE; n = 486) than of the in situ seeds (32 ± 2% SE; n = 564) indicated that mechanical dormancy is an important factor in the poor germination of teak.@@@Teak

Voss) were planted 0.5 m apart in intimate mixtures in 5 × 4 m plots, with two moisture regimes—irrigation versus control—and five species compositions—pure aspen (Aw100), mixed aspen and spruce (Aw83Sw17, Aw50Sw50, Aw17Sw83), and pure spruce (Sw100), replicated six times. Fifth-year assessments indicated that irrigation increased individual tree growth (height, RCD, crown width), plot leaf area index (LAI), and wood biomass. Increased aspen composition reduced the availability of soil moisture and consequently the growth of individual trees. With increased aspen composition more growth was allocated to stem in aspen and to foliage in white spruce. Comparatively, aspen responded more to irrigation and thus their growth is more dependent on precipitation than that of spruce. Among the three growth variables assessed, height responded more to irrigation in both species. Equal mixtures and aspen-dominated mixtures in control plots had higher productivity in terms of total wood biomass in both absolute and relative terms. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to managing aspen and white spruce mixedwood forests under increasing drought expected as a result of climate change.@@@Root collar diameter

D. Xu, which is only found in the semi-arid region of Northern China. For this purpose, six random transect belts of varying size were established in Baiyinaobao Natural Reserve. The number, height and age of P. mongolica saplings were inventoried. Results show that the total number of saplings per hectare and corresponding number and relative share of saplings in height class I (0.1–0.99 m) decreased along with increasing gap size, opposite to height class III (6–9 m). In height class II (1–5.99 m) the number of saplings per hectare and their relative share increased first slightly and then decreased with the increase of gap size. The number of saplings and their relative share in each height class changed similarly with the increase in the distance to the edge of the mature stand (p < 0.05). Gap age also significantly affect the number of saplings per hectare or their height distribution except in height class II. The distance to the mature stand edge played a very important role in the success of natural regeneration for species P. mongolica.@@@Canopy gap

This has been demonstrated in controlled environments and soils of various forest ecosystems. However, the role of root-absorbed amino acids in plant nitrogen nutrition is still poorly understood. We investigated the agroecological performance and nutrient use physiology of two conifers (Abies fraseri and Pinus resinosa) and one hardwood species (hybrid poplar) under amino acid fertilization. Arginine fertilizer (arGrow® Complete) was applied at varying rates (0, 56, 112, 224, and 336 kg N/ha) and compared to an inorganic control treatment (ammonium sulfate 112 kg N/ha). Parameters monitored included tree growth response, foliar nitrogen concentration, and inorganic nitrogen leaching below the rootzone. Results obtained indicate a significant growth and foliar nitrogen response to amino acid treatments, with increasing amino acid application leading to greater growth and foliar nitrogen. However, rates two to three times higher than that of the inorganic control were necessary to provide similar growth and foliar nitrogen responses. These observations were suggested to be due to competition with soil microbes for organic nitrogen, growth inhibition due to the presence of large concentrations of amino acids, or adsorption to cation exchange sites. Amino acid applications did not increase the leaching of inorganic nitrogen due either to the binding of positively charged arginine cations to exchange sites or rapid mineralization followed by plant assimilation. Mineral nitrogen collected in leachate samples increased with the application rate suggesting at least some mineralization in high amino acid application rates. We conclude that growth response and nitrogen use physiology of these species when treated with arginine are largely controlled by soil processes including microbial competition and adsorption.

This study tested whether changing the temperature of Corymbia citriodora and Eucalyptus dunnii stock plants from 28/23°C (day/night) to 18/13°C, 23/18°C or 33/28°C affected the production of cuttings by stock plants, the concentrations of Ca and other nutrients in cuttings, and the subsequent percentages of cuttings that formed roots. Optimal temperatures for shoot production were 33/28°C and 28/23°C, with lower temperatures reducing the number of harvested cuttings. Stock plant temperature regulated production of rooted cuttings, firstly by controlling shoot production and, secondly, by affecting the ensuing rooting percentage. Shoot production was the primary factor regulating rooted cutting production by C. citriodora, but both shoot production and root production were key determinants of rooted cutting production in E. dunnii. Effects of lower stock plant temperatures on rooting were not the result of reduced Ca concentration, but consistent relationships were found between adventitious root formation and B concentration. Average rooting percentages were low (1–15% for C. citriodora and 2–22% for E. dunnii) but rooted cutting production per stock plant (e.g. 25 for C. citriodora and 52 for E. dunnii over 14 weeks at 33/28°C) was sufficient to establish clonal field tests for plantation forestry.@@@Adventitious roots

Despite its high susceptibility to diseases, production losses caused by foliar diseases have not been properly quantified in this country. This study analyzes the effects of foliar damage on growth and survival using data from a progeny test of E. globulus naturally infected by Teratosphaeria leaf disease and eucalypt rust (Puccinia psidii). The severity of leaf spots and defoliation were quantified 8 months after planting and tree growth and mortality were evaluated 2, 4 and 6 years later. The trial had a high incidence of foliar damage, with a mean leaf spot severity of 28.7% and a mean defoliation of 37%. The greatest impact of foliar damage, both on growth rate and mortality, occurred in the first 2 years after damage was assessed. During this period, leaf spot severity less than 40% and defoliation below 50% did not affect growth, while survival was affected when leaf damage was 70% or greater. By the sixth year both stem growth and survival were affected by severe foliar damage (spotting or defoliation of 80% or more), with a loss of up to 25% in diameter and an accumulated mortality over 70%. It has been established for the first time that under the intensive Uruguayan productive conditions, E. globulus trees can tolerate a relatively high degree of leaf spotting or defoliation but severe foliar damage in the first months can cause considerable production losses, putting at risk the economical viability of this species.@@@Disease severity

Here we explore how seed production is affected by tree size, grazing by large domestic herbivores and interannual climate fluctuations in a small-sized tree (Polylepis australis, Rosaceae), which dominates the remnant forests in the high mountains of central Argentina. Seed number and seed mass per tree were quantified in 100 different-sized trees located in areas with and without livestock. Using seed traps we also determined seed rain variation in 15 plots between 2005 and 2008. The estimated number of seeds per tree ranged from 0 to 224,000 and increased with tree height (power relation); for trees smaller than 354 cm in height, seed production was lower in areas with livestock and higher in areas without livestock. Mass per seed increased with tree height, with no significant livestock effect. The largest seed rain was recorded in 2008, probably due to growth of seed trees and not in response to climate. To promote seed production and forest expansion, livestock should be excluded from areas with small trees, such as forest edges.@@@Mountain forest

Due to its great potential, it is necessary to select genotypes capable of increasing its production in the shortest possible time through genetic improvement strategies, where individuals are subjected to conditions forcing them to express their growth potential in advance. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the genetic variation among half-sib progenies and to estimate heritability (h 2) of stem height (SH) and diameter (SD) for seedlings grown under different competitive conditions in a common garden trial. A split-plot experimental design with four replications and three competitive environments (treatments) was used: (I) low inter-family competition (0.25 × 0.12 m), (II) high inter-family competition (0.12 × 0.06 m), and (III) high intra-family competition; 13 half-sib families were assessed, carrying out monthly evaluations for 10 months. Estimated h 2 at individual and family-means levels for both SH and SD varied among competitive environments. For conditions I and II, a trend towards increasing h 2 with age of seedlings was shown, but for condition III, a reverse trend was observed (values close to zero). High genetic stability in SH performance was found in both I and II, and II and III, pairs of environments, as measured by the type-B genetic correlation (0.70 ≤ r B ≤ 1.0), but it tended to decrease after 9 months, when competition increased; genetic stability in SD was lower (0.20 ≤ r B ≤ 0.80) in both pairs of the environments that were sampled. It was concluded that the competition conditions used in field trials for genotype evaluation may significantly affect the variance components, estimation of genetic parameters and genotype stability.@@@Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl.

Taxa comprised 22 populations from sources in Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Zimbabwe including Pinus elliottii var. elliottii (Pee), Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Pch), their four, inter-specific hybrids (F1, F2 and backcrosses from F1 to Pch and to Pee—all as broadly based bulks); other Pee and Pinus taeda (Pt) comprised narrower or unspecified bulks. Variable numbers of taxa were missing at each site. Mean survival across sites at age 10 years ranged 53.2–91.3% averaging 74.2%. Analysis of variance of plot means indicated population effect was statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all or most growth and quality traits at all sites. However, significant differences from the nominated check seedlot at the Entre Ríos sites (Pee, Australia) were extremely rare, while quite common at the northern, Misiones sites (check seedlot a Pt population). In the Misiones trials, F1, F2 and both backcross hybrids showed better stem straightness than Pee and Pt from Argentina, generally with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Pt showed lowest forking scores (desirable). Taxon × environment interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.01) for growth traits only (p > 0.05). However, this interaction contributed an average of only 34.1% of the taxon variance suggesting a lack of practical importance. Taxa most suitable for deployment in the Mesopotamia region, Argentina are suggested.@@@Pinus species

Numerous commercial AMF products are now available and are often used in preference to collecting indigenous AMF in treating restoration plants. Commercial AMF products are typically based on AMF strains exotic to the plant species and locations where they are used. We treated rooted cuttings of an endemic New Zealand tree species (Podocarpus cunninghamii) and an exotic and invasive grass (Agrostis capillaris) with an indigenous, pot-cultured AMF (Acaulospora laevis) and an exotic commercial AMF product (Glomus spp.). P. cunninghamii was grown in monoculture and together with A. capillaris, the latter to simulate field competition that often occurs in restoration plantings. In monoculture, the indigenous AMF resulted in significant increases in P. cunninghamii growth rates and tissue concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus. The commercial AMF had either no effect or a negative effect on P. cunninghamii growth and nutrient levels. A. capillaris growth and nutrient status were unaffected by the different AMF treatments. Competition eliminated any AMF benefit for P. cunninghamii. The results show that, for our chosen indigenous woody plant species, the commercially available AMF did not improve its early growth and nutrient acquisition in monoculture while, over the same period, the indigenous AMF induced positive growth and nutrient responses. These results have potential implications for forest restoration, particularly for nursery production of indigenous woody species.@@@Agrostis capillaris

The prediction of forest land use changes is important for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. This study investigates the modelling process of the spatial dynamics of a forest ecosystem in north eastern Greece. For the prediction of forest expansion, based on land use data of the study area, a deterministic approach using logistic regression and heuristic methods of multi-criteria evaluation is adopted. The set of factors driving forest expansion are: the slope, the distance to roads, the distance to urban areas, the distance to forest, the soil depth, the soil erosion and the influence from the land uses of the neighbourhood. The spatial autocorrelation of driving factors is addressed using an autologistic regression model. The multicriteria evaluation approach is developed using weighted linear combination (WLC) and ordered weighted averaging (OWA) methods. In WLC method the relative importance of each factor was estimated using the analytical hierarchy process. In the OWA method, decision strategies are generated using a selection of relative linguistic quantifiers, which allow different Risk in decisions. The accuracy of the models produced was tested with real data for the year 2001 using the ROC validation method. All the methods produced satisfactory results. Autologistic regression showed slightly better performance than multicriteria evaluation methods due to higher degree of objectivity in defining the importance of driving factors for forest expansion.@@@Forest expansion

In Fennoscandia, this period has recently stretched to the entire growing season. To evaluate the performance of seedlings planted during this extended period, three experiments were carried out in Central and Northern Finland over 2 years. One-year-old and current-year seedlings were planted in mounds or disc-trenched furrows when soil temperatures were >0°C. When 1-year-old seedlings grown for spring planting and overwintered outdoors were planted after mid-June, more needles browned and growth was reduced, possibly because seedlings were oversized with respect to planting density and the volume of growth media. When current-year seedlings sown in spring were planted from July to November, those planted in late September and October grew less in later years than those planted earlier, but survival was unaffected. No large differences in field performance were found with respect to whether seedlings were planted in mounds or disc-trenched furrows. In conclusion, Scots pine seedlings can be machine planted in mounds or furrows during May and early June (later in the North) and then continued from early August until late September, provided climatic conditions in late spring and early autumn are typical and similar to those experienced in Central Finland.@@@Pinus sylvestris

Predictions on climate change points out increase in aridity and changes in fire regime (increasing fire risk, recurrence and severity), particularly in the Mediterranean Basin. However, we have to question whether this implies a decrease in forest resilience and productivity. In summer 1994, large forest fires burned a huge surface of Aleppo pine stands in Spain. In areas naturally regenerated, we carried out early thinning and sampled 18 plots. In winter 2008 and 2009, we inventoried all pine trees in sampling plots, recording total height, diameter and canopy cover for scaling-up results to stand-level estimation. In addition, we destructively sampled 54 individual pine trees, selecting various thinning and dating treatments, to measure and estimate biomass and partitioning. The date of thinning influenced allometric relationships, earlier thinning stimulated the productivity of individual pine saplings, increasing the three components of carbon intake. Although, the total net carbon value was lower in almost all thinned plots (at least for short periods after thinning), differences were actually found depending on the cutting age and thinning severity. Control and thinned plots (mainly those thinned earlier and heavier) showed similar amounts of carbon but comprised in a low number of living trees with high productivity. Thus, productivity and carbon storage assessment should be monitored, in the long-term, to check prediction of proposed models for evaluation on early treatments.@@@Pinus halepensis Mill.

From numerous studies it has been determined that this is largely due to the pitch canker fungus, Fusarium circinatum. Other commercial pines, such as P. elliottii and P. taeda, show good tolerance to this pathogen and better survival, but have inferior wood properties and do not grow as well as P. patula on many sites in the summer rainfall regions of South Africa. There is, thus, an urgent need to improve the tolerance of P. patula to F. circinatum. Operational experience indicates that when P. patula is hybridized with tolerant species, such as P. tecunumanii and P. oocarpa, survival is greatly improved on the warmer sites of South Africa. Field studies on young trees suggest that this is due to the improved tolerance of these hybrids to F. circinatum. In order to test the tolerance of a number of pine hybrids, the pure species representing the hybrid parents, as well as individual families of P. patula × P. tecunumanii, a series of greenhouse screening trials were conducted during 2008 and 2009. The results indicated that species range in tolerance and hybrids, between P. patula and these species, are intermediate in tolerance to F. circinatum. Within P. patula × P. tecunumanii, large family variation exists when pollen from the high elevation source of P. tecunumanii is used. The results of these studies illustrate the importance of developing pine hybrid breeding programs to overcome the susceptibility of our pure species to pathogens such as F. circinatum.@@@Forestry

To contribute to a better understanding of the likely reasons for either the successful recovery of these forests or failure, the early response of stand structure and tree species diversity to strip-clearcut were studied in Okinawa Island, southwest Japan. The 4,000 m2 study area was divided into 10 adjacent sections of equal area with a 10 m × 10 m sampling plot in the center, of which five sections were strip-clearcut while the remaining five sections uncut. Eight-year secondary succession following strip-clearcut showed that the density of woody stems, tree species diversity increased significantly not only in the regenerating stands but also in the residual stands compared to the primary stands. The primary dominant target species, Castanopsis sieboldii, continued to dominate both the regenerating and residual stands although colonizing species invaded abundantly in the stands, occupying approximately one-third of total tree species in each treatment. The community similarity analyses showed that the species composition were similar between the primary stands and the regenerating stands or residual stands reflected the high similarity amongst the primary stands and the regenerating stands or the residual stands. The similar stand structure, high tree species diversity and greater community similarity after strip-clearcut provided no evidence of forest degeneration, suggesting that the regenerating stand might gradually develop into stand similar to that prior to strip-clearcut.@@@Stand structure

Initial efforts have focused on reestablishing Acacia koa to recover alien-grass-dominated sites. This study was done in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Island of Hawaii, to determine the efficacy of disk plowing to stimulate natural regeneration of koa from buried seeds. Sites with four different koa parent tree configurations were treated–single live overhead koa canopy, multiple live canopies, downed snags, and no parent koa tree. Tree growth and survival were assessed periodically over 21 years. Average initial stand densities ranged from 100 to 1,500 trees ha−1 of scarified land, although some open areas had as few as 20 trees ha−1. The distributions of seedlings with increasing distance from plot center were variable within and between parent tree configurations. Initial seedling density was significantly greater for the multiple-live-parent than for the no-parent configuration. Densities for the single-live and dead configurations differed from the no-parent configuration only when densities were based on the entire scarified area of each plot. Stand densities declined 10–67 % during the next 20 years. Survival was a negative, non-linear function of initial stand density. Initial stand density exerted strong control over stem diameter and crown size at age 21-years, but had little effect on the proportion of trees with single-stems. The relationships between stand basal area and density at 21 years conformed to the existing koa stocking guidelines. While moderate to high densities of natural regeneration can be expected from scarifying around live and dead koa trees, single trees or low density stands are likely in open areas.@@@Forest restoration

This study investigated the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus mosseae and Glomus constrictum) and water stress on the growth and physiological performance of S. davidii seedlings under greenhouse pot conditions. Two soil water availability treatments (well-watered (WW) −0.10 MPa; water-stressed (WS) −0.86 MPa) were applied for 61 days. At the end of this experiment, G. mosseae and G. constrictum had colonized the roots of S. davidii seedlings. Water stress inhibited AM colonization, plant growth, chlorophyll concentration, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of S. davidii seedlings. Mycorrhizal seedlings had greater shoot dry weight, root dry weight, plant height, root length, instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), lower intercellular CO2 concentration and photochemical quenching values (qP), when compared with non-mycorrhizal seedlings under both WW and WS conditions. Furthermore, G. constrictum was found to be more efficient at improving the shoot and root mass, plant height, iWUE, Pn, gs, qP, and ΦPSII of S. davidii seedlings, when compared with G. mosseae under both WW and WS conditions. Our results demonstrate that AM Glomus symbiosis enhanced S. davidii seedling resistance by improving its growth and physiological performance under water stress conditions. This suggests that Glomus inoculation is a potential tool for enhancing outplanting performance of S. davidii in semiarid areas of China.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

Ten natural populations were used to assess variation in seed weight, germination characteristics and biochemical reserves and to examine the relationship between these characteristics. The analysis of variance showed highly significant population effects for seed weight, germination characteristics and protein content in both seeds and the female gametophyte. The mobilization of protein content in female gametophyte during seed germination differed more among populations than sugar content, suggesting that protein content was more sensitive to environment effects than sugar content. A strong positive correlation between germination capacity and the protein content in both seeds and female gametophyte indicated that the best populations in term of germination capacity may also be the richest in protein content. Seeds that were heavier and had a lower speed of protein content mobilization in the female gametophyte appeared to be better adapted to drought conditions. The results also suggested that as much as possible of the potentially valuable genetic variation among populations of this species should be preserved for reforestation and conservation purposes.@@@Maritime pine

Reforestation may offer one means of mitigating these processes of degradation while sustaining biodiversity conservation. However a lack of information regarding trees, in particular threatened tree species has been identified as an important limitation in being able to reforest for biodiversity conservation. In the current study, conducted in the Tan Phu “protection forest”, the investigation surrounds the feasibility of biodiversity restoration in a fast-growing plantation after logging. Twelve threatened and native species mainly belonging to the Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae families have been considered. Seedlings grown in a local nursery have been planted under the canopy of a 50 ha pioneer forest, with a distance of 5 m between plants and between rows. The experimental design consists of blocks, each one with a replication of a 16-tree plot for each species. Four years after plantation, the survival rate of seedlings is high (>70 %), except for Dipterocarpus costatus (<10 %). Growth shows possible inhibitions under a closed canopy but the mean annual increment is generally satisfactory. The early performance of the seedlings is promising to make this plantation a good example of biodiversity restoration. These results could enhance the reforestation efforts of forest managers and encourage them to use native tree species including threatened ones in order to restore a high level of biodiversity in tropical degraded forests.@@@Enrichment planting

We also used 12 microsatellite markers to genotype the 328 progeny and their maternal parents. Seedling family growth and quality was evaluated based on the progeny test map. These values were compared to family growth and quality after seedlings were genotyped and reassigned to families by parentage assignment software. After genotyping and parentage analysis, about 80 % of the offspring were assigned to the same half-sib family indicated on the planting map. Considerable differences were observed between the ranks of half-sib families based on the planting-map versus the ranks of the families based on the exclusion/assignment of progeny to their family based on genotypes. Analysis of the data without genotypic assignment of progeny to their correct family revealed that the family effect for height was significant, as was family effect for diameter. After seedlings were reassigned to half-sib families based on genotypic information, neither the family effect for height nor the family effect for diameter was significant. The efficiency of the mixed model ANOVA, as measured by Akaike Information Criterion improved by about 30 % after genotyping and exclusion/reassignment of progeny. These results show that genotyping progeny can have a significant effect on the rank of families and potential selection of individuals from a progeny trial, the quality of data analysis, and the efficiency and efficacy of breeding operations.@@@Microsatellites

Thirteen clones of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) were crossed in a 4 × 9 tester mating design and 36 full-sib families were generated. There were significant variations in major growth traits and heterosis of growth traits among the 36 full-sib families. A total of 115 alleles were detected with 30 sets of SSR primers. Genetic distances (GDs) among the crossed clonal pairs were calculated based on SSR data. Parental GDs was significantly correlated with all traits evaluated in the full-sib progeny test (P < 0.05), and the correlation coefficient was 0.398, 0.463 and 0.473 for tree height, DBH and wood volume. Parental geographical divergence was also significantly correlated with growth traits of progeny, while the correlation coefficient was lower than that of GDs. These results demonstrated the potential and feasibility of SSR markers for predicting progeny performance of Masson pine. Considering the influence of genotype × environment interaction effect on the stability of full-sib family performance, our results regarding the moderate contribution of parent GDs in predicting the performance of their full-sib progenies is of importance mainly for the specific region where the progeny test was carried out.@@@Genetic distances

Our objective was to identify initial seedling morphological characteristics that successfully predict field performance of five Mediterranean species (Pinus halepensis, Quercus ilex, Quercus coccifera, Ceratonia silqua and Pistacia lentiscus). Container seedling morphology was evaluated following the nursery phase, and then seedlings were outplanted in the field where field survival was monitored for two successive years. Results indicate that survival can successfully be predicted from seedling initial morphological characteristics for all these species, yet not all the initial characteristics were good predictors. Survival of P. halepensis and Pist. lentiscus seedlings was positively correlated to initial seedling root-collar diameter, total dry weight and Dickson’s quality index, and can be reliably predicted by these variables. In contrast, seedling field survival of the two Mediterranean evergreen oak species was correlated with few initial morphological attributes; initial diameter provided an accurate index to predict second-year outplanting survival for both species while height/diameter was a good survival predictor for Q. coccifera seedlings. For C. siliqua seedlings, seedlings with larger initial diameter and total biomass survive better in the field. Thus, diameter was the common variable that accurately predicted survival for all species, which should be >5 mm for P. halepensis seedlings and >7 mm for the remaining species.@@@Field performance

Established in 1960, the study tests three circular openings, 15.2 m (0.02 ha), 45.7 m (0.16 ha), and 76.2 m (0.46 ha). Forty-eight years following treatment (2008) basal area, top height, and quadratic mean diameter were significantly lower in 15.2 m openings. Maple (Acer spp.) species had the highest mean importance value across treatments (0.40). Trends suggest that species composition of dominant and codominant trees among opening sizes may have been influenced by shade tolerance adaptations of the species groups present. Whereas 15.2 m openings were dominated by shade tolerant maple species, 45.7 and 76.2 m openings produced a mixture of commercial species including shade intolerant species such as yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), trees of intermediate shade tolerance like oak (Quercus spp.), and shade tolerant maple. Data further suggest the density of overstory oak was highest in the intermediate opening size (45.7 m), while yellow-poplar increased in the larger opening sizes. Evaluation of species shifts between 1981 and 2008 showed that relative basal area of maple increased across all treatments. Relative basal areas from 45.7 to 76.2 m openings suggest declines in yellow-poplar and other non-commercial species were balanced by increases in oak and maple.@@@Quercus

Seed traps placed along transects in unmanaged and shelterwood stands in each of 3 blocks were used to monitor seed production in 2000 and 2006 (4 and 10 years after harvesting). During these 2 mast seed years between 386,000 and 2,730,600 seed ha−1 were produced among study stands. Total seed production expressed on a per hectare and unit pine basal area basis did not differ by harvest treatment or among blocks in either year. Variability in seed production among stands was primarily due to differences in stand structure, with seed production positively related to white pine basal area. Seed characteristics were largely similar between harvested and unmanaged stands and between seed years. Seed viability was relatively high in both years, with seed from shelterwoods germinating slightly slower than those from unmanaged stands. Seed quality, as estimated by laboratory germination performance, was higher in 2006 than 2000, likely due to improved seed development and maturation in the warmer, wetter growing season of 2006. Our results suggest that the seed cut of the uniform shelterwood system applied to second growth white pine stands is unlikely to adversely affect white pine seed production, seed quality, or potential for natural regeneration during mast seeding events.@@@Germination

However, questions remain as to how these new stands develop and what kind of species they favour, which in turn has impacts on their ecological and economical value. Our aim was to compare understorey vascular plant and bryophyte vegetation characteristics between naturally regenerated and planted birch stands on abandoned agricultural sites in Estonia, focusing on the aspects of species richness and forest understorey recovery. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in both stand types but the number of forest vascular plant species was significantly higher in naturally regenerated stands. The bryophyte layer of naturally regenerated stands had a higher species richness, diversity, and number of forest bryophyte species. The higher number of forest vascular plant and bryophyte species in naturally regenerated stands can be explained by the longer undisturbed succession period. The recovery of the forest understorey was unaffected by former agricultural land use (crop field or grassland). The influence of soil properties on the recovery of the forest understorey was not detected, but the number of vascular plant species that grow in forests as well as in grasslands was negatively correlated with distance from forest. Overall, understorey vegetation of natural and planted birch stands did not reveal substantial differences. However, in the case of vigorous natural birch regeneration in the vicinity of forest land, unassisted reforestation should be favoured.@@@Plantations

Greenhouse bioassays were set up to determine the influence of three different soils on growth and phosphorous nutrition of Polylepis australis seedlings. Soils were collected from a grassland, a rare mature forest and a forest degraded due to repeated fires. We identified the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) present in the three soils and after 12 months we harvested the seedlings to evaluate root and shoot biomass, plant P content and root colonization by native AMF and dark septate endophytes (DSE). The soil inocula contained 26 AMF morphospecies. Grassland inoculum showed the highest AMF richness, and mature forest showed a different AMF community assembly from grassland and degraded forest inocula. Root biomass and root colonization were highest in seedlings inoculated with mature forest soil, meanwhile shoot biomass and plant P content were similar between all treatments. AMF colonization correlated negatively with DSE and root biomass was negatively correlated with DSE colonization, thus these fungal symbionts could be competing for resources. Our results indicate that AMF inoculum from the mature forest stand has the potential to improve P. australis performance, probably due to the dominance of Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae families. However, other soil microorganisms could be together with AMF in the natural inocula, affecting the growth response of P. australis seedlings. Future studies evaluating the effect of these inocula under field conditions should be carried out.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

A method for detecting regional species pools at two different scales: biogeoclimatic classes (CLATERES classification), and forest landscape types (WWF classification) has been proposed. Then, the Absence percentage for a species (i.e. the proportion of landscapes types or biogeoclimatic classes in which the species is included in the regional species pool but is actually not present) was determined. Results show higher figures of Potential Species Richness in the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Range, while inland or coastal Mediterranean semiarid landscapes have lower figures. Using a classification based on biogeoclimatic variables (CLATERES) improves precision when estimating Absent Species Richness. Absence percentage is zero or close to zero for five species (Pinus uncinata, Quercus robur, Quercus ilex, Quercus humilis and Juniperus communis), while for other six species (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus angustifolia, Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, Sorbus aucuparia and Pinus pinea) the figures are higher than 0.6, which means the species is absent in more than 60 % of the landscapes or biogeoclimatic classes that it could inhabit. The relationships between tree life traits and the absence of species from the ecosystems studied is slight but non-dominant species, species not subjected to forest management, or zonal species are less widely distributed that their climatic potentiality indicates.@@@Tree species richness

After adjusting seed moisture content, seeds of two lots were subjected to warm treatment for 0–6 weeks followed by 0–50 weeks of chilling. The seeds then were allowed to germinate at a constant 15 °C with 8 h lighting per day or 20 (dark)/30 °C (light). Some seeds were treated in the fully imbibed (FI) state in a medium (standard operational treatment). Seed lot effects were evident, but treatment effects were consistent in each lot. Warm treatment greatly increased germination and reduced precocious germination. The presence of a medium was not required to achieve high germination and seed moisture content close to the FI state was needed to maximise germination. Climate change may reduce the ability of this species to regenerate naturally, favouring other species that require less chilling.@@@Seed moisture content

A change in forest composition, compared to pre-industrial values, is an important biodiversity issue. In this regard, there is a significant decrease in Picea glauca densities at the landscape level in boreal mixedwoods of northeastern Canada, compared to pre-industrial abundance. Enrichment planting is considered a promising silvicultural approach for improving P. glauca stocking and re-establishing its natural co-dominance with Abies balsamea. However, optimal enrichment scenarios must be identified, notably regarding site preparation treatments that can enhance planted seedling survival and growth while protecting Abies advance regeneration. We established a field trial in Quebec (Canada), laid out as a complete block split-plot design. Picea glauca and P. mariana seedlings (main plot) were planted according to 3 “microsite” treatments (subplot): (1) planting in the humus layer; (2) planting in the mineral soil, with minimal humus disturbance; and (3) planting in a microsite mechanically-prepared using modified brushsaws. After 3 growing seasons, P. mariana seedlings were taller than P. glauca seedlings, but had smaller ground-level diameters. Seedlings planted in the mineral soil had overcome the initial height difference they had with seedlings planted in the humus and mechanically-prepared microsites, with no interaction with species. Ground-level diameter was similar for seedlings planted in the humus and mechanically-prepared microsites, but smaller for seedlings planted in the mineral soil. Water potentials, available light, and foliar nutrient concentrations were not influenced by treatments or species; survival was >90 %. Our results indicate that P. glauca can be established through enrichment planting in boreal mixedwoods. Localized site preparation is not required to limit initial plantation stress in this ecosystem.@@@White spruce

Trees for analyses were sampled from plots with zero nitrogen input (n = 4), plots with high level (187 kg N ha−1) nitrogen input (n = 4), plots from which weed growth was not removed throughout the rotation (n = 4) and plots from which weeds were removed periodically (n = 4). Fibre characteristics were evaluated on wood samples collected from base, breast height, 50, 75 and 100 % of merchantable bole height of trees. Though N input and weed management improved tree growth significantly irrespective of species, the treatment effects did not cause any significant change in fibre characteristics such as fibre length, fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness. Longest and widest fibres were observed at the outer most radial portion of wood in all cases. In general, within tree fibre length varied significantly along the radial direction of wood. Fibre diameter, lumen width and wall thickness lacked any specific pattern between species and treatments. Runkel ratio and felting and flexibility coefficients values showed high pulping quality of wood irrespective of species and treatments. The study concluded that the fibre properties that influence pulpwood quality of Eucalyptus have not been affected by silvicultural practices, like fertilizer input and weed management, aimed at improving productivity of short-rotation eucalypt plantations.@@@Eucalyptus

There is lack of allometric equations for biomass estimation of woody species at sapling stage in tropical dry forest (TDF), and therefore, the carbon stored in this forest component is ignored. We harvested 46 woody species at sapling stage in a TDF and developed regression models for the biomass estimation of foliage, branch, bole and the total aboveground part. For foliage and branch biomass, the models with only stem diameter as estimator showed greater R 2. For bole and aboveground biomass, the models including wood specific gravity or wood density exhibited higher R 2 than those without wood density. Also, the model consisting of wood density, stem diameter and height had the lowest standard error of estimate for bole and aboveground biomass. Moreover, the R 2 values are very similar among models for each component. The measurement error of height and the use of a standard value of wood density together may introduce more than 2 % error into the models. Therefore, we suggest using diameter-only model, which may be more practical and equally accurate when applied to stands outside our study area.@@@Aboveground biomass

The first two fertilization treatments were based on Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS), a method based on nutrient ratios: DRIS I was based on previously established norms from a study that had been conducted in the same area, and DRIS II was based on DRIS norms developed from hybrid poplars in northern Ontario, Canada. Nutrient status and growth of trees under these 2 treatments were compared to unfertilized trees and to trees under standard (STD) fertilization treatment (40 N–20P–20 K). Leaf nutrient concentrations and DRIS indices showed that fertilization treatments, and especially DRIS I corrected N deficiencies but failed to correct P deficiencies. Fertilization increased volume relative growth rate by 7.51, 4.76 and 13.25 % on average at the agricultural site for DRIS I, DRIS II and STD treatments respectively, compared to no fertilizer application. At the forest site, fertilization treatments based on DRIS indices (DRIS I and DRIS II) increased growth rates (6.67 %) slightly more than the standard treatment (5.80 %). Overall, although DRIS-based fertilization treatments generally increased growth rates, they were often equal to or less efficient than the STD treatment, and may not be as practical as using a standard fertilization recipe.@@@Forest plantations

The fact that spore use as EM inocula is inexpensive and effective, makes it an option more realistic than vegetative inoculum production for many regions around the world. To determine spore activity from EM species selected as inoculants for Nothofagus pumilio and exotic conifers planted in Patagonia, two conservation methods were applied (i.e., dried fruit bodies and spore slurries), and their change over time was assessed (over 8–9 months). Spore activity decreased significantly with time for both native and exotic EM species. Conservation methods showed no significant differences for N. pumilio EM species considered together or for exotic conifer EM species. However, spore activity of different EM species behaved differently with conservation method and over time when considered separately. Taxa which better kept spore activity over time were Austropaxillus statuum and Setchelliogaster fragilis for N. pumilio, and Inocybe kauffmanii for exotic conifers. However, considering together fruit body spore density and spore activity, the species Hallingea purpurea and Cortinarius sp. also appeared as suitable for N. pumilio and Rhizopogon roseolus, R. villosulus, Suillus luteus and S. lakei for exotic conifers. Spore density found in EM fungal fructifications were also established in order to estimate fructification weights necessary to apply a reference dose of active spores in inoculation programs.@@@Ectomycorrhiza

We review the potential for seedling nutrient loading to alleviate these post-planting stresses. A growing body of evidence indicates that nitrogen (N) rich seedlings have improved field performance in Mediterranean environments, due to their ability to grow new roots rapidly and out-compete weeds. In addition, frost resistance during hardening is crucial for relatively cold inland nurseries; recent research shows a positive relationship between N and shoot frost resistance though a knowledge gap exists regarding the influence of nutrition on root frost resistance. Some new evidence also implicates phosphorus as an important driver of seedling response in the Mediterranean due to its influence on root growth and physiology. Nutrient status influences other functional attributes critical to survival in Mediterranean areas, such as drought tolerance, root hydraulic conductivity, and mycorrhization. In light of the apparent benefits of high nutrient reserves for seedling performance in Mediterranean areas, we also review techniques for nursery nutrient loading. Exponential fertilization can be applied when species’ growth patterns match this application regime. However, many Mediterranean species exhibit episodic growth indicating that constant or fall fertilization could be more effective in reaching loading. In particular, late-season fertilization has shown good potential to avert nutrient dilution in the fall and increase frost resistance. Several needs for future research are identified, with special emphasis on the necessity to match fertilization regimes to species ecological traits and planting conditions.@@@Plant nutrition

Additionally, stored nutrients may aid seedlings in recovery from browse damage. High plant nutrient content may, however, deem seedlings more susceptible to ungulate browsing because of increased foliar protein content and, thus, nutritional value. Research examining the relationship between fertilization of forest trees and ungulate herbivory has been conducted almost exclusively in boreal and temperate zones of North America and Europe, and has produced two common themes. The first is that nearly all trials used broadcast application of fertilizer. This method supplies nutrients to both the target species and competing vegetation, resulting in significant increases in nutritional value for all potential forage. The second common theme is that there is a higher likelihood of browse for fertilized plants. Exceptions to this thread exist, however, because browse preference of fertilized seedlings is apparently species-specific due to differences among species in resource allocation. Palatability appears to interact with the production of plant chemical defenses (i.e., alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids). Variations in plant mineral nutrition and secondary metabolite production can play a significant role determining forage preference; however, ungulates under starvation or stress will browse plants of high toxicity or low nutritional value to maintain fitness.@@@Fertilization

Repeated fertilization increased volumes of both cedar and hemlock on CH sites (at 2,500 stems ha−1) by about 100 m3 ha−1 relative to unfertilized plots 22 years following initial fertilization, and increased the productivity of regenerating conifers to a level approximating that of neighbouring hemlock-amabilis fir (HA) sites. More surprising was the response to fertilization on the more-productive HA sites. After 22 years, cedar in fertilized HA plots had produced an extra 180 m3 ha−1 compared to unfertilized HA plots, while hemlock had produced an extra 250 m3 ha−1 in fertilized plots (at 2,500 stems ha−1). Thus, contrary to expectations, the greatest volume responses of both hemlock and cedar to fertilization occurred on the good (HA) sites rather than on the poor (CH) sites. Ecological studies of CH and HA sites supported the hypothesis that the poor nutrient supply and productivity of CH sites is a long-term consequence of excessive moisture, and that the two site types bracket a critical ecological threshold of moisture, aeration and redox.@@@Silviculture

In drylands, harsh climate conditions and unfertile soils often preclude seedling establishment. The improvement in seedling quality by manipulating nutrient availability could contribute to increase planting success. However, morpho-functional traits defining optimum seedling quality in drylands, and the fertilization schemes to achieve them, are still under discussion. Several studies suggest that well fertilized seedlings may perform better than nutrient limited seedlings in these environments. However, recent works have shown opposite results. In this review, we discuss the concept of seedling quality in drylands based on an evaluation of the effects of nutrient manipulation on seedling morpho-functional traits and field performance. According to existing data, we hypothesize that nutrient-limited small seedlings may be better adapted to arid environments and unfavorable microsites, where access to water is uncertain and a conservative water use strategy may be advantageous. In contrast, in dry sub-humid areas, areas with deep soils, protected from excess radiation, and areas where irrigation is feasible, well-fertilized big seedlings with high root growth potential may have more chances of success. We discuss this theory in the context of the multiple objectives of dryland restoration and the environmental constrains posed by these areas, and identify knowledge gaps that should be targeted to test our hypothesis.@@@Nursery fertilization

Fertilization may alleviate nutrient deficiencies, but broadcast fertilization with immediately available fertilizers (IAF) results in generally low rates of nutrient recovery for planted trees. Directed application of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) to the rhizosphere offers an alternative to extend nutrient longevity while reducing nutrient leaching or uptake by competing vegetation. We evaluated white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) development on a mine reclamation site in the Oil Sands Region of northern Alberta in response to IAF and polymer-coated CRF (3–4 and 8–9 month release). IAF and CRF (each NPK plus other macro- and micro-nutrients) were applied at 20 and 40 g N seedling−1 and 2 and 4 g N seedling−1, respectively. No effect on seedling survival occurred. White spruce year-1 height and diameter growth responded positively to both IAF and CRF relative to non-fertilized controls, but in year-2 seedlings treated with CRF (i.e., 8–9 month) outperformed those fertilized with IAF, which were similar to controls. Aspen height growth did not respond strongly to fertilization in either year, but diameter growth showed positive responses to all fertilizer treatments in year-1 and to all CRF treatments and the high IAF rate in year-2. Responses were attributed to a pronounced increase in vegetative competition observed for IAF relative to CRF or controls following the first growing season, and generally higher levels of foliar N in year-1 for CRF compared to IAF or unfertilized trees. Thus, directed root zone application of CRF promoted seedling growth responses similar to or better than those induced by broadcast IAF applications, but at 90–95 % lower N application rates.@@@Competitive interactions

The purpose of the study was to explore possible causes of observed variations in mean tree heights in various portions of the stand. An expected link to total depth of the fine textured glaciolacustrine reclamation capping material was not found. Instead, a strong relationship was found between tree height and organic matter (OM) content (by % dry weight), where OM is in the form of predominantly mesic peat mixed with the capping material at the time of placement. Possible OM-related causes of the height growth effect could include (a) contributions to water holding capacity of the soil and (b) contributions to soil nutrition. Contributions to water holding capacity could not be evaluated in this study, but the lack of correlations to total capping depth suggests that moisture may be of lesser importance as a growth limiting factor on this site. Nitrogen supply was identified as the most likely nutritional deficiency. For current soil OM content, substantial increases in tree heights were measured with OM increases to approximately 8 %, followed by marginal increases in tree height with OM greater than 8 %. This study offers a relatively inexpensive methodology through which oil sands operators can test for similar relationships over a broad range of site and stand conditions, and evaluate the benefits of varying their allocation of OM resources to achieve optimum tree growth benefits at the landscape scale.@@@Oil sands

We analyzed if nitrogen (N) fertilization during nursery cultivation enhances the outplanting performance of two ecologically distinct oaks, Quercus coccifera L. an evergreen shrub, and Quercus faginea L., a deciduous tree. Additionally, we compared the sufficiency N levels of both oaks and if root growth capacity (RGC) and photosynthesis testing at low air temperature better discriminated among fertilization treatments than testing at mild temperature. Plants were cultivated under five N fertilization rates (0, 30, 75, 150 and 200 mg N plant−1) for one growing season. At the end of the cultivation period several plant material and performance attributes were measured. RGC and photosynthesis were assessed at mild temperature and cool conditions in Q. coccifera, while in Q. faginea these attributes were only analyzed at mild temperature conditions. Q. coccifera seedlings were transplanted into four terraces that imposed increasing drought stress, while Q. faginea seedlings were transplanted into an abandoned wheat cropland. Sufficiency level was higher for the tree (150 mg N plant−1) than for the shrub (75 mg N plant−1) Nitrogen-deprived Q. coccifera plants had higher frost damage than remaining treatments, which did not differ among them. Fertilization in Q. faginea did not affect photosynthesis rate but it delayed leaf senescence and abscission. RGC increased with fertilization in both species. Testing temperature did not change the effect of fertilization on RGC in Q. coccifera. Photosynthesis in cool conditions discriminated N-deprived seedlings from the remaining treatments, but treatments did not differ in photosynthesis at mild temperature. Fertilization enhanced outplanting survival in Q. coccifera, primarily in the terraces imposing stronger drought stress, while fertilization only increased growth in the terraces imposing mild drought stress. Overall, survival and growth was positively related to seedling size at planting in both oaks. Additionally, Q. coccifera survival was also positively related to RGC in the harsh planting conditions. Field growth was positively related to RGC and plant N concentration in both oaks but the relation was weak or nonexistent under harsh conditions in Q. coccifera. We conclude that fertilization in the nursery is an important tool for improving the success of oak plantations in Mediterranean continental sites, and that large and N-rich seedling have greater field performance than small and low tissue N concentration seedlings, especially in harsh field sites.@@@Afforestation

Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2 × 2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.@@@Growth-limitation hypothesis

Boron deficiency causes growth disorders affecting young Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. We studied the effects of B fertilization on the growth and morphology of Norway spruce seedlings. Boron was applied in a nursery and/or after planting in a nursery-field and on a reforestation site, both known to be low in B. The B applied in the nursery increased foliar B concentration in a linear relationship to the amount of B fertilizer but did not affect seedling growth and morphology. Even the highest foliar B concentration (approx. 400 mg kg−1) did not have harmful effects on the seedlings. Therefore, B fertilization in the nursery can be used for increasing B storage in needles. Boron fertilization at planting increased foliar B concentration in the first season. Afterward, the concentration decreased but remained above the deficiency limit for at least 4–5 years. In the B-poor nursery-field, nonfertilized seedlings began to produce multiple leaders in the second year. On the reforestation site, fewer multiple leaders were found. At the nursery-field site, height growth was stimulated by B fertilization at planting. In conclusion, 200–400 mg m−2 (2–4 kg ha−1) of B applied at planting has longer-lasting effects on seedling B status than does B fertilization applied in the nursery, and can improve seedling quality and growth in the first years after planting on B-poor sites.@@@Boron deficiency

This study investigated the effects of split fertilizer applications on seedling growth and biomass production, nutrient uptake, and FUE for the Guanglin No. 9 clone [hybrid of Eucalyptus grandis (Hill ex Maiden) × Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake]. Three application timings and a control were established at rates of 125 and 250 g inorganic fertilizer (16N–7P–7K) per seedling. Split application played a more pronounced role than fertilization rate in eucalypt seedling growth and biomass accumulation. Compared to a single-time application, split applications increased eucalypt seedling height and root collar diameter growth, biomass, and nutrient uptake. The ratio of root to seedling dry mass showed a decreasing trend with split applications, whereas ratios of stem and branch to seedling dry mass tended to increase with split applications. Split applications also significantly improved FUE compared to the single-time application treatment. Findings of this study suggest that split applications of inorganic fertilizer with two application times could be an appropriate fertilization method to improve seedling growth and FUE of this eucalypt clone.@@@Inorganic compound fertilizer

Over a rotation, where there were no significant additions of nutrients, there were small declines in productivity from the first to the second rotation while productivity increased in the third rotation usually due to changes in management. On sites treated with significant quantities of phosphate fertilizer (50 kg P ha−1) in the second rotation, there were significant increases in the productivity of the second rotation with a residual effect into the third rotation. The early growth in the second rotation may be higher than the first rotation but the growth changes with age. Rotation length productivity appears to be related to the magnitude of soil nutrient pools. Nutrients such as calcium, potassium and boron appear to be affecting long term growth even though the foliage levels are much higher than normally considered limiting for growth. Most of the differences in productivity between rotations appear to be related to soil nutrients or management changes while potential genetic gains as estimated from experimental trials, are difficult to identify.@@@Productive capacity

Two types of responses to treatments have been identified; temporary changes that offer a time gain that becomes constant after site changes cease to affect growth (type I) and persistent changes that result in a continuously increasing time gain throughout a crop rotation (type II). An alternative to this statistical approach is to use a hybrid physiological/mensurational model of forest production that explicitly represents growth processes underlying observed responses. We compared a regional hybrid growth and yield model with a purely mensurational one for representing observed responses in two site preparation experiments in the Central North Island region of New Zealand. Simulations were initiated with crop measurements following the first 5 years of growth in the two experiments, along with reasonable estimates of impacts of site preparation on sites and growth processes. These estimates of site changes were made prior to the simulation and were not varied after simulation results were known. The hybrid model successfully predicted a type I response following weed control and a type II response following soil cultivation, while the mensurational model failed to represent the type II response. Growth in basal area without soil cultivation was underestimated by 3 m3 ha−1, leading to an overestimate of gain. A hybrid modelling approach is therefore an alternative to a purely statistical time gain analysis that can provide useful estimates of gain so long as changes to sites and growth processes made by site preparation are well understood.@@@Site preparation

(cork oak) nursery and field seedlings@@@@@@Received: 01 March 2013 Accepted: 31 August 2013 Published: 06 September 2013 Issue Date: November 2013@@@Mediterranean ecosystems are characterized by large arid areas where the patchy distribution of trees offers little protection against harsh climate conditions for seedling establishment. Climate change is predicted to result in an increase in these arid regions, with pronounced effects on vegetation. Production of seedlings with developed ectomycorrhizas is a promising strategy for minimizing the initial transplant shock, thereby increasing plant survival and growth during the first, most critical years of a plantation. One important species in the Mediterranean basin is Quercus suber (cork oak), which occurs, together with other evergreen oak species, in an agro-silvo-pastoral system that represents an example of sustainable land use in Europe. In this study, a Pisolithus tinctorius isolate was used for ectomycorrhizal colonization of cork oak nursery seedlings, and the effects on aboveground plant growth and leaf structural and physiological parameters were investigated. Ectomycorrhizal development resulted in a significant increase in leaf area, dry weight, nitrogen content, and photosynthetic pigments, and mycorrhizal plants showed a higher photosynthetic capacity and water use efficiency. Nursery-inoculated plants established in the field showed increased survival and growth during the first year after transplant. These results indicate a potential for further enhancing the use of mycorrhizal inoculation as a cultivation practice in forest nurseries. Considering the difficulty of soil restoration under limiting environmental conditions, nursery inoculation with ectomycorrhizal fungi can be an important advantage for improving the quality of seedling stock and its performance after out-planting in the field, benefiting the regeneration of arid regions and the reintroduction of inocula of ectomycorrhizal fungi into these areas.@@@Ectomycorrhizas

Sample trees from each stocking and rectangularity combination were harvested at age 7 years and assessed for the commercially important wood properties of bow, as an indication of growth strain, shrinkage and basic density. Crown length ratio was used as an indicator of stand vigour and clear wood availability. Furthermore comment is made on the financial ramifications of wide inter-row spacing. Stocking and rectangularity significantly influenced bow but not shrinkage or basic density. Reducing within-row spacing to 2 m with a larger between-row-space of 6 m had minimal affect on wood properties. Reducing the number of rows, whilst still retaining a commercial stocking, reduces the establishment costs and increases the ease of mechanical harvesting without adversely affecting log value.@@@Eucalyptus pilularis

However, before site selection occurs, there is a need to know how the soils and climate of the prairies and central regions affect willow productivity. Soil, foliar, and climatic variables were therefore measured along with yields at nine “first rotation” Salix purpurea ‘Hotel’ plantations from central Alberta to southern Ontario. Correlation analysis was used to identify those parameters having the most influence on yields. Relationships between soil and climate and growth were established by regression analysis. The acid–base status of the soil as dictated by bulk elemental composition, in particular the presence of Ca, was found to be the dominant factor affecting productivity (r = 0.967, P < 0.001 total Ca vs. yields) despite large regional differences in climate. From a nutritional standpoint, total soil N (r = 0.743, P = 0.048) and foliar K (r = 0.938, P = 0.009 for sites with adequate moisture) were positively correlated with growth. S. purpurea ‘Hotel’ yields were found to be primarily limited by water availability at the two lowest productivity prairie sites. Soil total Ca concentration, pH and total organic C concentration were all generally correlated with higher yields. Additional deficiencies appeared in the following order of importance: water > N and K > Mg. As a whole, soil properties were the dominant predictors of ‘Hotel’ growth in this study, which suggests that, even at the regional scale, growth was governed in large part by the capacity of soils to retain water and/or nutrients. Climate played a lesser role, except perhaps at two sites which appeared to receive inadequate moisture.@@@Biomass energy

Fertilization levels beyond optimum could result in excessive diameter growth that reduces seedling quality as measured by the root bound index (RBI). We grew longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), a grass stage species, in containers of four different volumes (60–336 ml) either coated with copper oxychloride or left untreated and fertilized at low, medium, or high levels of nitrogen (N). In general, N concentration of tissues rose as N rate increased, with larger changes in concentration occurring between low and medium levels than between medium and high levels. N rate influenced root tissue N concentration less than it did stems and needles. Subtle needle color differences caused by N rate were significant, suggesting its potential utility during nursery production. As expected, seedlings grew larger as container volume increased and as N rate increased. Copper treatment, which we posited could influence the RBI, tended to increase root-collar diameter and tap root biomass and decrease total root volume. Chlorophyll abundance was affected more by N rate than by container volume or copper treatment, but photosynthesis was affected more by copper treatment than N rate or container size. Although RBI was 25 % greater for seedlings grown in small containers with high N rates than those grown in large containers with low N rates, RBI ranged only from 11 to 15 %, well below the critical 27 % threshold.@@@Pinus palustris

This study assessed the performance of an important indigenous species, Khaya grandifoliola, in pure and in mixed stands, and compared its performance to the exotic tree species, T. grandis. The results from the study indicated that after 4 years, there was a significant difference in the diameter of K. grandifoliola (P = 0.001) between pure and mixed stands with the pure stands having an average diameter of 9.15 ± 0.19 cm compared with 7.81 ± 0.33 cm for mixed stands. Pure stands had a correspondingly higher basal area at breast height for individual trees in pure stands compared with mixed stands. K. grandifoliola also recorded average total height of 5.50 ± 0.13 m and merchantable height 3.63 ± 0.09 m in pure stands, compared to total height of 5.04 ± 0.24 m and merchantable height of 3.52 ± 0.18 m in mixed stands. However, these values were not significantly different between the stands (P > 0.05). Basal area at breast height for K. grandifoliola grown in pure stands was 5.5 ± 0.3 m2/ha at age four, which was significantly higher than the basal area of 1.1 ± 0.4 m2/ha at breast height for K. grandifoliola in mixed stands. Also total volume per hectare was higher in pure stands (17.8 ± 0.9 m3/ha) than in mixed stands (3.4 ± 0.6 m3/ha). Consequently, K. grandifoliola accumulated more carbon in pure stands (10,126 ± 557.2 kg/ha) than in mixed stands (1,976 ± 335.1 kg/ha), but the mixture of the tree species, including K. grandifoliola, accumulated more carbon (11,929 ± 401.3 kg/ha) than the K. grandifoliola in pure stands though not statistically different. Overall, K. grandifoliola performed better in pure stands than in mixed stands. With regards to the tolerance to pest attacks on K. grandifoliola, it was more tolerant to pests’ attacks in mixed stands than in pure stands. There was no statistical difference in diameter growth between K. grandifoliola (9.15 ± 0.19 cm) and T. grandis (9.61 ± 0.26 cm) in pure stands. The values of total height, merchantable height and total volume for T. grandis were 8.22 ± 0.20 m, 5.38 ± 0.18 m and 22.5 ± 1.7 m3/ha respectively which differed significantly from 5.50 ± 0.13 m, 3.63 ± 0.09 m and 17.8 ± 0.9 m3/ha for K. grandifoliola for the same parameters (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two species with respect to basal area per hectare (P = 0.189); K. grandifoliola grew to 5.5 ± 0.3 m2/ha and T. grandis grew to 4.8 ± 0.3 m2/ha. T. grandis in pure stands accumulated slightly more aboveground biomass than K. grandifoliola in pure stands after 4 years though not statistically different.@@@K. grandifoliola

For non-deciduous seedlings in the nursery, fall fertilization typically can reverse nutrient dilution and possibly increase nutrient reserves; however, this technique has received little attention with deciduous conifer trees that translocate nutrients before abscising foliage. We evaluated how fall nitrogen (N) fertilization affected N storage and translocation in the deciduous conifer Olga Bay larch (Larix olgensis Henry) seedlings during the hardening period. Seedlings were supplied with 25 mg N seedling−1 for 15 weeks before hardening and fall fertilization treatments began with a three week application period of K15NO3 at 0, 5, 10 and 15 mg N seedling−1. During the hardening period, fall N fertilization had little effect on seedling morphology. The N concentration and content of needles decreased dramatically as needles abscised, while that of stems and roots increased. Six weeks after fall N fertilization ceased, all seedlings translocated similar net N from their needles. For the control seedlings, this accounted for 84 % of the N stored in stems and roots. For fall fertilized seedlings, however, the proportion of N stored in stems and roots translocated from needles accounted for only 41–61 % of the total because of absorption of fall fertilizer that was translocated directly to stems and roots. Six weeks after fall fertilization, the distribution pattern of N concentration and content in seedlings was found in this order: stems > fine roots > coarse roots > needles. Our results suggest that providing deciduous conifer seedlings N during hardening, in this case Olga Bay larch, is a way to promote nutrient loading during nursery production.@@@Fertilizer use efficiency

The main objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the physical stability of composts produced from shredded branches of Acacia cyanophylla and A. cyclops subjected to a repeated drying and wetting cycles, similar to those used at the operational scale in nurseries in arid regions and to compare these composts with a standard peat-vermiculite (PV) substrate; (2) to identify the relevant substrate physical variables that correlate with seedling growth. Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) was cultivated during a production cycle of 27 weeks in a completely randomized block experiment. Substrate physical variables were measured at the beginning, middle and end of the experiment. Seedling growth variables were evaluated over the course of the production cycle, while gas exchange and water-relation variables were measured during a wetting and drying cycle at the end of the experiment. All three substrates produced vigorous seedlings with well-developed root systems that colonized the entire root plug. The growth of seedlings produced in the PV substrate was better than those grown in the compost-based substrates. No significant differences in gas exchange capacities and water relation variables were observed among the three substrates at the end of experiment with the exception of net photosynthesis, which was higher for the PV substrate at high substrate matric potential. Excessive drainage was negatively correlated with growth variables while water availability in the early growth phase and air porosity towards the end of experiment were positively correlated. Performance of the two composts could be increased by improving their initial structure and stability and by adjusting the irrigation regime.@@@Acacia

Karst. population in the Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland@@@@@@Received: 11 May 2012 Accepted: 25 April 2013 Published: 03 May 2013 Issue Date: November 2013@@@We studied temporal changes in the genetic structure and diversity of a naturally regenerated Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) population in the Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland. The analysis included five age classes of trees: newly germinating seedlings (in laboratory conditions), seedlings up to 3 years old, young trees 4–10 years old, middle-aged trees 11–100 years old, and trees older than 100 years. We conducted genetic analyses of 26 allozyme loci using dormant buds from 405 individuals and 100 embryos. The results showed that the naturally regenerating Norway spruce population is genetically heterogeneous across the studied age classes. As determined by Chi squared tests, there were statistically significant differences in frequencies of alleles and genotypes as well as Wright’s index values (F) among the five age classes. The level of genetic differentiation (pairwise FST = 0.5–2.3 %) among the age class groups was equal to levels previously determined for various populations of this species. The Ewens-Watterson test for neutrality showed that one or two loci across different age classes of Norway spruce were affected by the selection process. The distinctiveness of embryo and seedling classes was confirmed by the number of detected alleles, the number of private alleles, the level of observed heterozygosity, and Wright’s index value. The results obtained in the present study indicate there are interesting dynamics of adaptation processes occurring in the natural age-diverse population of Norway spruce in the Białowieża Primeval Forest.@@@Age dynamics

The species’ regeneration dynamics is well documented in the centre of its range, but is poorly understood at the northern limit of continuous distribution. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified natural white pine regeneration in unmanaged mature stands, identified the most important variables influencing it, and evaluated the impact of damaging agents, namely white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.), white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck), and herbivory. We also quantified the influence of remnant stands and residual trees on the spatial distribution of regeneration in logged sites. The results reveal continuous but low recruitment in mature stands. The basal area of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) had a strong negative effect on white pine regeneration. Regeneration was more abundant than expected on moister substrates, including moss, decaying wood and organic matter. White pine regeneration was noted in recently logged areas, where distance from remnant stands had a significant effect on the abundance of white pine regeneration. The northern limit of continuous distribution holds potential for white pine restoration, for example by preserving remnant white pine stands that can provide seed sources for natural regeneration in a shelterwood cut system, or in adjacent clearcut areas. This study illustrates that different management strategies should be used near northern range limits, where effects of site conditions and disturbance agents are different than in the center of a species’ range.@@@White pine

The seedling emergence process together with germination is a key adaptive stage in any seeding species. We aim to analyze variability in seedling emergence traits within and among marginal populations of Patagonian Cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis (D.Don) Pic. Ser. et Bizzarri), which have been suggested to be of conservation relevance. We performed an emergence trial in a greenhouse with seeds collected from 177 open-pollinated trees from 10 populations. A sigmoidal curve was fitted to the cumulative emergence data (in percentage of the sown seeds) for each replicate of each family. Variability was estimated using ANOVA for six variables: emergence capacity (EC), emergence energy (EE), energy period (EP), emergence initiation (t 10), emergence cessation (t 90) and emergence duration (Dur). The overall trial mean for EC was 76.2 %, while EE was only 27.6 %. Hence, most seedlings emerged after the energy period, which is interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy. Both “population” and “family” factors significantly affected all variables. The proportions of “family” variances were higher than “population” ones for EC, EE, Dur and t 90, but the opposite was found for EP and t 10, which is evidence of differentiation among populations. Variability among families may be due to both genetic and environmental causes, including maternal effects. However, the relatively high proportion of family variability in EC and EE suggests acceptable levels of additive genetic variance, which would not hinder the potential to evolve in these specific traits. Conversely, the chances to adapt in EP and t 10 are lower, and consequently local extinctions driven by global climate change seem possible.@@@Adaptation

This study revisited experimental forest edge sections 16 years after their establishment to assess the impact of five design elements on (1) horizontal and vertical edge structure, (2) growth of planted species and species groups, and (3) spontaneous establishment of woody vegetation. The design elements were: exposure to direct solar radiation; edge typology (shrub mixture, mixture of trees and shrubs, no edge planting); width of edge planting (5 or 10 m); species mixture principle (intimate mixtures or single species grouping); and planting row position from outermost to interior planting row (max. 6 rows). The results demonstrate that edge plantings support significantly more spontaneous woody vegetation than stand boundaries without such edge plantings. This result was consistent across the different design elements. Position across the planting rows from the outermost to innermost row was the most influential design element for the development of planted seedlings. Planted tree and shrub species of similar shade tolerance had contradicting development, where light-demanding pioneer tree species had obtained dominant positions while shade-tolerant shrub species had outgrown more light-demanding species. These results demonstrate that important successional processes can be activated by establishing the initial components and structures of forest edges. When designing such edges, species should preferably be allocated to different row cohorts reflecting their growth form and shade tolerance.@@@Afforestation

A smallholder-based project in the Visayas region planted native species instead. This study assessed the growth performance of forty-four native and sixteen introduced species in 25 sites established by this project between 1995 and 2000. Diameter at breast height and total height were measured for 2,789 trees. Mean annual increments for diameter (MAID) at breast height and height (MAIH) were significantly higher for trees planted on limestone-influenced soils (MAID = 1.19 cm/year; MAIH = 1.05 m/year) than on purely volcanic soils (MAID = 0.81 cm/year; MAIH = 0.78 m/year). Growth of two native species, Melia dubia and Terminalia microcarpa, was higher than that of the widely planted exotic Swietenia macrophylla. The height increment for the highest-performing dipterocarp species, Shorea guiso, Shorea contorta, and Parashorea malaanonan, was not statistically different from the MAIH of S. macrophylla. A range of soil characteristics predicted performance, with organic matter predicting growth for six species, and percent nitrogen and percent clay predicting performance of five species. These findings show that certain native species can perform better than some exotic species when planted in open areas. They also disprove the widely held belief in the Philippines that Dipterocarpaceae cannot be planted in grasslands, and suggest that dipterocarps can be used successfully in reforestation. Finally, the findings show that more research is needed on species-site matching and on silvicultural management of native species plantations.@@@Dipterocarpaceae

Karst.] two commercial seed lots were soaked for 15 h in aerated water. After soaking, floating and sunken seeds were separated and analyzed prior to being sown in peat-filled containers. Seedling development was followed for one growing season. All sunken seeds were viable according to radiography whereas the floating seeds contained a considerable number of larvae filled and empty seeds. Mean time of emergence of the sunken seeds was approximately 1.5 days shorter than control (i.e. dry) seeds and floating seeds. Soaking had no effect on the time taken for most germinants to emerge in both seed lots, thus failing to synchronize seedling emergence. The later a seedling would emerge, the more likely it was for it to die during the growing season or to be culled at the end of the growing season. Soaking had an inconsistent effect on stem diameter at the end of the growing season and no effect on stem or root biomass. Seedling size uniformity was equal in all treatments. This study suggests that soaking and seed sorting does not guarantee a more uniform seedling crop, but this technique may be useful in upgrading poor quality seed lots of Norway spruce containing a high number of empty or larva infested seeds.@@@Container seedling

The study has been conducted in three Aleppo pine forests of northern Euboea Island, Greece. Postfire field surveys of sapling growth, sapling density and reproductive dynamics (cone-bearing population fraction, annual cone and seed production per sapling, canopy seed bank build-up) were carried out for three, consecutive growing seasons (years). Additional postfire parameters, with values estimated from literature data, have been also included in order to devise the RP. In the cases of the three populations studied, the application of this RP provides time-windows for full recovery after a recurrent fire, as short as 10–15, 8–11 and 7–11 years, respectively (values corresponding to best and worst scenarios). It is suggested that in even-aged, postfire regenerating Aleppo pine populations, the minimal inter-fire period required for full recovery can be predicted by monitoring a few selected variables, namely (a) sapling density, (b) vegetative to reproductive shift dynamics, and (c) cones/sapling and germinable seeds/cone, for at least 2 years (either consecutive or 2–3 years apart) at a postfire age of 7–12 years.@@@Postfire regeneration

This study investigated factors affecting the carbon content of nineteen tropical plantation tree species of ages seven to twelve and compared carbon content of Khaya species from two ecozones in Ghana. For all sample trees, volume of the main stem, wood density, wood carbon (C) concentration and C content were determined. Estimated stem volume for the 12-year-old trees varied widely among species, from 0.01 to 1.04 m3, with main stem C content ranging from 3 to 205 kg. Wood density among species varied from 0.27 to 0.76 g cm−3, with faster growing species exhibiting lower density. Significant differences in wood density also occurred with position along the main stem. Carbon concentration also differed among tree species, ranging from 458 to 498 g kg−1. Differences among species in main stem C content largely reflected differences among species in estimated main stem volume, with values modified somewhat by wood density and C concentration. The use of species-specific wood density values was more important for ensuring accurate conversion of estimated stem volumes to C content than was the use of species-specific C concentrations. Significant differences in wood density did exist between Khaya species from the wet and moist semi-deciduous ecozones, suggesting climatic and site factors may also need to be considered. Wood densities for these plantation grown trees were lower than literature values reported for the same species in natural forests, suggesting that the application of data derived from natural forests could result in overestimation of the biomass and C content of trees of the same species grown in plantations.@@@Biomass

"721","The rooting of poplar cuttings: a review@@@@@@Received: 11 April 2013 Accepted: 16 September 2013 Published: 26 September 2013 Issue Date: January 2014@@@Poplar (Populus spp.) is one of the most important economical tree species in temperate regions of the world. Easy propagation by cutting has made most of the selected genotypes of poplar available for intensive plantation with large genetic gains. Critical point for successful propagation of cutting is the development of roots. Thus, rooting context of the cutting appeared to be a pivotal scenario in poplar vegetative propagations. In this overview, we focus on the progress in defining the genetic, physical, chemical and environmental factors that influences the poplar cuttings to develop adventitious roots. These factors include genotype effect, physiological conditions of the stock plants, plant growth regulators, temperature, rooting substrates/media as major variables for the development of rooting events.@@@Poplar

These SC produced male and female strobili at an early stage. Pollen, cones and seeds produced were characterized (mass, size, germination); their characteristics were similar to those produced by trees in natural forests or seed orchards. A maternal effect was demonstrated for the cone size and seed mass. Although seeds had excellent germination rates, the somatic biparental crosses were divided into three distinct groups with different germination curves using the Weibull function. Seeds from controlled crosses between different SC enabled the production of high morpho-physiological quality seedlings in a forest nursery. Using black spruce as a model, we showed, for the first time, that SC can be used as seed producers. These encouraging results open new perspectives on the tangible integration of somatic embryogenesis (SE) in the chain of seed, vegetative propagation (cuttings and SE) and production of plants for high productivity plantations. Controlled crosses can be made between SC with the desired characteristics (fewer large branches, fewer nodes, good growth, high wood density, performance, improved yield, etc.), vegetative propagules produced and deployed to clonal tests. After elimination of the worst performing SC, clonal tests can be converted into seed orchards that produce a new generation of seeds of high genetic quality. This will allow the rapid introduction of new materials in elite breeding programs of forest species.@@@Somatic clones

Silvicultural methods that target oak regeneration, such as the creation of canopy openings and removal of shade-tolerant midstory trees, are complicated by the impact of pre- and post-dispersal predators of oak acorns like acorn weevils (Curculio spp.) and granivorous small mammals. Understanding the effects of forest disturbance created by silviculture on these predators is important to promote successful oak regeneration. We conducted a 6-year study of acorn production, weevil infestation, and acorn removal at 113 black (Q. velutina) and white oak (Q. alba) trees impacted by three types of silvicultural treatments: adjacent to harvest openings, midstory removal (first-stage shelterwood harvest), and control (no harvest) in south-central Indiana, USA. We observed highly variable acorn production across years, but minimal impact of silvicultural treatments. Levels of weevil infestation and acorn removal by small mammal seed predators also varied greatly, and predation pressure was highest in years when acorns were scarce. Weevil infestation was reduced following midstory removal in shelterwood harvests, but probability of acorn removal by small mammals was unchanged following harvest. Damaged, germinated, and weevil-infested acorns were less likely to be removed by seed predators, suggesting additive effects of pre- and post-dispersal predators. This study emphasizes the importance of considering acorn predators in oak regeneration silviculture, and timing harvests to follow large acorn crops in order to reduce predation pressure and generate a high number of seedlings.@@@Oak

Evaluating the field performance of such material is critical for determining the success of breeding programs. In eastern North America, The American Chestnut Foundation has a backcross breeding program that uses Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) to introduce resistance of the fungal pathogen chestnut blight [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr.] to the native American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.]. We compared physiological and morphological characteristics among seedlings of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and BC1F3, BC2F3, and BC3F3 hybrid chestnuts during their fourth growing season after field-planting. American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation displayed photosynthetic light-response curves that were similar to each other but different from Chinese chestnut. Rates of photosynthesis were higher for American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation when compared to Chinese chestnut for light levels ≥800 μmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetic photon flux density and for maximum photosynthetic capacity. Leaf morphology variables were not different between American chestnut and any of the breeding generations, but leaf area (on a per leaf basis) of Chinese chestnut was lower than that of any other chestnut type. Our results suggest that backcross breeding can be used to transfer desirable traits for restoration of native species threatened by non-native pathogens.@@@Backcross breeding

About one-third of the state-owned forestland has been classified as commercial forestland, but no economic mechanisms have been laid out on governing timber plantations under market economy. This paper demonstrates the potential investment returns and analyzes factors that directly influence the returns of fast-growing poplar plantations in a state owned-forest enterprise, China Jilin Forest Industry Group (CJFIG), in northeastern China. We examined practically possible ranges of mean annual increment (MAI), general inflation rate, rate of forest fund, and interest rate in the study area. We then computed net present values (NPV), equivalent annual income (EAI) and internal rate of return (IRR) by using the minimum, medium, and maximum values of the each determinant above. Results showed NPV ranged from $1,024 to $6,925 ha−1, EAI ranged from $120 to $623 ha−1 year−1, and IRR ranged from 13.2 to 29.3 %. We show that growing poplar plantations could be two times more profitable than managing the existing natural forests in CJFIG by referring to EAI values. Improving MAI is the most effective way to increase both NPV and IRR while changes in the one-time tax at timber harvesting or changes in inflation rate have the least effect on NPV and IRR among the determinants studied. Discount rate, which can be easily manipulated by obtaining subsidies and policy-based loans, also has substantial influence on NPV. The state owned forest enterprises in China have special advantages to obtain relatively high economic returns in developing fast-growing plantation forests under market economy.@@@Forest regeneration

Sensitivities of transpiration responses to both evaporative demand and rainfall under contrasting soil water conditions constitute the physiological basis of the drought tolerance of trees. Such knowledge is practically significant for plantation management, especially for irrigation management. We therefore conducted a 6-year study on the transpiration of a poplar plantation in temperate China to elucidate the existence and pattern of the influence of the soil water over stand transpiration responses to (1) vapor pressure deficit (VPD), the major indicator of air dryness and (2) the rainfall, in terms of total amount and event size. The results showed that the response of plantation transpiration (E c ) to VPD was conditioned by soil moisture. There was a significant difference in the frequency distribution of maximum sap flux under contrasting soil relative extractable water. E c after rainfall of different sizes varied under similar VPD. The increasing occurrences of only large rainfall events led to enhanced total E c during the growing season, but prolonged rainless intervals did not lead to a continuous decrease of E c , suggesting appreciable supplements from the soil water were present to sustain transpiration. In addition, the balance of soil water between replenishment and extraction also conditioned the influence of rainfall over subsequent E c during the respective rainless intervals. Based on the E c responses to VPD and rainfall under different soil moisture levels, irrigation that directly replenishes the deep soil layers in order to alleviate water stress on transpiration during the small-rain event-dominated growing season is an effective and water-saving approach to guarantee trees survival during drought period.@@@Rainfall pattern

In stands which had been deciduous (Populus sp.)-dominated, conifer (white spruce)-dominated, or mixed pre-fire we measured regeneration stocking (presence in 10 m2 plots), density and height 10–20 years post-burn in five wildfires in Alberta, Canada. Most plots regenerated to the deciduous or mixed stocking types; plots in the older fire and in stands that were pure conifer pre-fire had higher amounts of conifer regeneration. Surprisingly, regeneration in pre-fire ‘pure’ white spruce stands was most often to pine, although these had not been recorded in the pre-fire inventory. Pre-fire deciduous stands were the most resilient in that poplar species dominated their post-fire regeneration in terms of stocking, density and height. These stands also had the highest diversity of regenerating tree species and the most unstocked plots. High grass cover negatively affected regeneration density of both deciduous and conifer trees. Our results demonstrate the natural occurrence of regeneration gaps, pre- to post-fire changes in forest composition, and high variation in post-fire regeneration composition. These should be taken into consideration when developing goals for post-harvest regeneration mimicking natural disturbance.@@@Direct regeneration hypothesis

Land use change, shifting climate, and poor natural regeneration are making it increasingly difficult to establish the species; therefore, artificial regeneration is critical to ensure this timber species maintains its productive role on the landscape. New stocktypes are continually being developed to aid target seedlings for difficult sites, and critical, non-confounding evaluations of them are needed for target seedling development. This research evaluates the effect of container parameters on potential target seedlings. It examines tolerance thresholds of western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) with respect to moisture and temperature status in the rhizosphere during early establishment. A suite of morphological measurements was used to assess seedling quality and relative performance following transplant. Modifying a commercially available container developed four distinct stocktypes of 111, 143, 175 and 207 ml that were paired with a volume-dependent nutrient regime at two culturing densities. Seedling phenotype was affected to a greater extent by container density than by container volume. Despite changes to container volume, root:shoot were found to be similar, indicating benefits of a tailored nutrient regime during nursery culture. Simulated field trials revealed that a low density growing arrangement improved post-transplant seedling growth, specifically root growth. Also, the 207 ml container facilitated greater growth in dry soil conditions compared to smaller containers. Lower (10 °C) rhizosphere temperature hindered root growth; however, seedling survival was 100 %, warranting the testing of earlier outplanting windows for this species. This evaluation of stocktype performance contributes to a greater body of work with this species and its congeners, which will ultimately benefit reforestation and afforestation efforts alike.@@@Regeneration

We need a methodology, therefore, to identify the best species for fuelwood production in drier sites. We used a methodology that could be used to identify the best fuelwood species for drier and wetter sites in regions where there are steep rainfall gradients. We investigated variation in growth and fuelwood properties of five species (Balanites aegyptiaca, Combretum glutinosum, Guiera senegalensis, Piliostigma reticulatum, Ziziphus mauritiana) along rainfall gradients. Growth parameters (tree height, stem diameter under bark, mean ring width) and fuelwood properties (basic density, volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash content, moisture content, gross calorific value, gross calorific value per cubic meter, fuel value index) were adjusted for tree age. For each species, linear regressions were used to determine the effects of mean annual rainfall and geographical coordinates, which were correlated with rainfall, on tree growth and fuelwood properties; and the effects of tree growth on fuelwood properties in lower, intermediate and higher rainfall zones. Geographical coordinates explained more variation than rainfall, and relationships with rainfall differed among species. Larger trees had wood with higher basic density, fixed carbon, ash content, moisture content, gross calorific value and/or gross calorific value per cubic meter, but lower volatile matter and/or fuel value index. Relationships between growth and fuelwood properties were not significant in all species and rainfall zones. Based on this study, we recommend producing fuelwood of C. glutinosum and G. senegalensis.@@@Tree height

In 2006, ten plots of 50 m × 50 m were randomly selected in two site types. Site type A is covered by Quercus pubescens–Quercus frainetto stands that are under grazing pressure. In Site type B there are Q. pubescens stands and grazing pressure is more intense. Inside these plots 180 subplots of 2 m × 2 m were established in three regeneration environments and the number of sprouts and seedlings was counted. The three regeneration environments were: (a) rather dense groups of trees, (b) areas with bare soil that alternate with areas with grazed herbs and (c) areas covered only from sparse scattered trees. Moreover the regeneration plants were classed as recently grazed and not recently grazed plants. Six years later, 180 regeneration plants having a height equal to or over 20 cm were selected and were classed as seedlings or sprouts. Sprouts were the dominant form in regeneration. The sprouting ability of Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto seems to be an adaption that enables them to endure grazing. Grazing was the main factor that determined the distribution of regeneration. The ecological differences of the two species do not seem to substantially influence their distribution in the different regeneration environments. It seems that intense grazing keeps the regeneration plants in low height. However, regeneration density can be considered adequate for the perpetuation of the studied stands if the grazing stops.@@@Quercus pubescens

Recent studies indicated that large and nutrient rich plants perform better in Mediterranean areas, suggesting that late-season fertilization may improve plant quality and field performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of late-season fertilization on the quality of Holm oak seedlings, as determined by morphological, nutritional, and water relations analyses. We grew Holm oak nursery seedlings under 5 different late-season fertilization regimes and then analyzed morphological characteristics, nutritional status, and water relations parameters of the fertilization groups at the end of the nursery period. We also analyzed the effect of fertilization on nutritional status by use of vector nomograms. Our results indicated that late-season NPK fertilization improved shoot and root growth, and the overall nutritional status of seedlings. The lack of late-season fertilization leads to nutrient deficiency in plants, whilst the application of imbalanced fertilization treatments may trigger nutrient luxury consumption and nutrient dilution, pointing out the importance of NPK proportions in the fertilizer. Moreover, late-season fertilization with nitrogen might improve the drought resistance of seedling by enhancing their osmotic adjustment.@@@Autumn fertilization

Short-rotation breeding programs are increasingly working on wood quality traits; however, we keep on treating them as if they were growth traits. Understanding tree-level patterns of variation can lead to alternative strategies for evaluation, analysis and inclusion in breeding objectives; which I describe in a pilot application in Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Finally I discuss the relationship between the breeder’s equation and formulations of linear mixed models, using genotype by environment interaction as example, to show the interplay between genetic evaluation and breeding strategies. There is tension between increasing complexity (and the implicitly promised flexibility), information recovery (as more parameters are poorly estimated) and computational demands. The latter can be tackled through much more computer power (a never-ending endeavor), exploiting features of the problem or moving back to a lower complexity level.@@@Early screening

GS is now routinely used to select superior bulls in dairy cattle breeding. In forest trees, a few empirical proof of-concept studies suggest that GS could be successful. However, application of GS in forest tree breeding is still in its infancy. The major hurdle is lack of high throughput genotyping platforms for trees, and the high genotyping costs, though, the cost of genotyping will likely decrease in the future. There has been a growing interest in GS among tree breeders, forest geneticists, and tree improvement managers. A broad overview of pedigree reconstruction and GS is presented. Underlying reasons for failures of marker-assisted selection were summarized and compared with GS. Challenges of GS in forest tree breeding and the outlook for the future are discussed, and a GS plan for a cloned loblolly pine breeding population is presented.

The first crosses were initiated during the early 1990s and lead to establishment of field trials across a wide variety of sites. This work gained further impetus when it became apparent that Fusarium circinatum, was causing poor post-planting survival of newly established stands of P. patula. P. tecunumanii, has been shown to be tolerant to this disease and thus a second, more comprehensive hybrid testing phase was implemented. Improvements in controlled pollination techniques and propagation methods, as well as access to genetically improved parent-stock and the use of molecular marker technology for fingerprinting was effectively utilized to greatly improve the process during this second phase. The use of artificial inoculation trials have demonstrated that the hybrid, in particular when using the low elevation (LE) provenances of P. tecunumanii, had substantially greater tolerance to F. circinatum than P. patula and survival figures from field trials support these results. Four-year volumes also indicate large growth improvements, although frost damage on certain sites presents a challenge for deployment on colder sites; and this is being tackled through breeding and accurate mapping of frost risk. Large-scale controlled pollinations and vegetative multiplication are now utilized commercially to produce the P. patula × P. tecunumanii (LE) hybrid as an alternative to P. patula.@@@P. patula

However, individual trees respond to the much shorter impacts of climate variability. Historically, fast growing, fully canopied, non-chronically stressed (NCS) trees (e.g., those with minimal insect or disease damage, growing on high nutrient, moist soils), have been considered the model of individual health, while slower growing, broken crown, chronically stressed (CS) trees growing on nutrient poor, or dry soils, were considered to be unhealthy and prone to stress related mortality. Over the coming years and decades, climate variability (e.g., extreme precipitation events, drought, heat waves) is expected to increase. We hypothesize that as the duration, severity and interaction of stress becomes more pronounced under increasing climate variability, seemingly less healthy, CS trees could begin to survive environmental stress better than their traditionally considered healthy, NCS tree counterparts. We further hypothesize that this shift in survivorship will be attributed to tree response to increasingly extreme climate variability at levels not previously observed in recorded history. While NCS trees can better survive historic episodic stress, we hypothesize that CS trees may be better suited to survive the combination of chronic low-level stress, and extreme episodic stress associated with anthropogenic climate change and increasing climate variability. Specifically, morphological differences such as increased root and reduced leaf mass, and physiological differences such as more oleoresin production, could make slower growing, CS forests more resilient to catastrophic episodic mortality compared to more NCS stands under certain circumstances. General circulation models suggest that climate variability will increase in the future. Therefore, the occurrence of slow growth, CS forest stands out surviving faster growing NCS less stressed stands may become more common place, and eventually lead to “The Age of the Mediocre Forest”. This paper addresses the type of environmental conditions that could create such an inverse in forest health conditions, and the implications that this shift might have in forest genetics and management.@@@Anthropogenic climate change

From an applied perspective somatic embryogenesis (SE) is expected to play an important role in increasing productivity, sustainability, and uniformity of future forests. For commercial use, SE technology must work with a variety of genetically diverse trees. Since the first reports of SE in Picea abies and Larix decidua in 1985, many different coniferous species have shown the ability to produce embryogenic tissue. However, initiation frequency is often low, many desired seed sources are recalcitrant, and culture survival is often poor, raising costs of somatic seedlings produced from successful genotypes. A number of tools are now available to improve embryogenic tissue initiation and somatic embryo development in vitro that have resulted from analytical studies of seed tissues, the seed environment and gene expression in megagametophyte, zygotic embryos and somatic embryos. Benefits have occurred from medium supplementation with hormones, plant growth regulators, hormone inhibitors and polyamines. Somatic embryo growth has been enhanced with medium supplementation of nutritional components including specific sugar types, vitamins, organic acids, and redox potential modifiers. Control of environmental factors including, water potential, pH, adsorption of medium components by activated carbon and liquid versus gelled medium have also led to SE protocol improvements. The use of analytical studies to duplicate the seed environment in vitro is improving protocol development resulting in increased initiation, improved yields and higher-quality somatic embryos.@@@Conifer

Lacking in the literature is a comparative analysis from a broader perspective such as pines from temperate versus tropical regions. Also, important information that may have beneficial implications for pine breeding and management purposes may be missed by going with a single generalized reproductive cycle model which is usually derived from well-studied northern temperate species. Detailed developmental analysis of the reproductive process is necessary, particularly for tropical pines where information is limited. Most pines undergo a reproductive cycle that spans three calendar years with two dormant periods. In temperate pines, many of the stages that are initiated by fall generally come to a halt during the winter and development resumes in spring of the following year. In tropical pines, reproductive development appears to be generally a continuous process characterized by a gradual rate of development with indistinct first dormant period. The distinct first dormant period in north temperate pines serves to synchronize pollen release and seed-cone receptivity which results in higher pollination success and seed production. Tropical pines exhibit asynchrony in pollen release and thus has extended pollination period. Relatively less pollen are available which results in lower pollination success and seed set. Interestingly, since asynchrony may enhance cross-pollination, tropical pines might benefit from this through the capture of genetic diversity. The length of the second dormant period is generally the same in temperate and tropical pines which indicates strong genetic control.@@@Conifers

Tree improvement is now part of operational silviculture programs in many companies and countries around the world and tree breeding programs have produced very impressive results: (1) realized gains in plantations being established today of some 40–50 % in volume yield above unimproved material for many programs; (2) increased efficiencies in all aspects of breeding, selection, testing and deployment; and (3) a shortening of the generation interval by a factor of two from approximately 30 years in the first generation to less than 15 years today for pine programs. What about the future? What should tree breeders be thinking, planning and doing to ensure that results 60 years from now are even more impressive than those from the previous 60 years? Tree breeders today live in a rapidly changing world faced with: increasing demands for food, energy and water; globalization leading to an interconnectedness of markets and rapid spread of exotic organisms; climate change and its implications for genetic deployment; burgeoning technology in robotics, communications and molecular tools; shifting ownership patterns of forest land; and the real possibility of completely new forest products and markets in the future.

Don@@@@@@Received: 14 June 2013 Accepted: 19 November 2013 Published: 29 November 2013 Issue Date: May 2014@@@Major challenges exist for applied gene conservation of forest genetic resources in native habitats of the Mexican and Central American Pines, Pinus radiata and the Southern US pines. They include population decline and population structure changes, due to forest removal, conversion of forest land to other uses, fires, climate change, diseases and pests. However, tree breeders continue to struggle with methods that would meaningfully integrate tree breeding and conservation populations. In this review, I will start by outlining the importance of gene conservation in tree breeding programs, then highlight some challenges and opportunities for applied gene conservation programs; and lastly, I share results of a large body of applied research and other activities aimed at genetically characterising the base population of P. radiata in Australia and New Zealand, for the purposes of effective ex situ gene conservation. Main threats for species grown in exotic environments also include introduced diseases and pests, and more recently, climate change. Consequently, movement of genetic material is often restricted and genetic resources of pine species are not readily expanded by further importations from overseas. Therefore, conservation of genetic material currently in these countries is likely to be important for the long-term viability of plantation forestry using pine species. In addition to understanding the largely unpredictable or speculative biological and economic worth of rare alleles, the greatest challenge that we have in ex situ gene conservation is to develop practical approaches for infusing genes from base populations of unimproved material into more advanced-generation breeding programs without greatly affecting productivity gains. Other notable challenges include perceived costs and benefits of gene conservation in the face of increasing privatisation of forest estate. While financial resources for domestication of alternative species are declining, a vast number of existing species and provenance/progeny trials of P. radiata, the Mexican and Central American pines and the Southern US pines provide an excellent gene resource for the future.@@@Genetic diversity

Many concepts of phase change, the intensity and duration of changes that occur during the phase transition, and the practical consequences of plant maturation for growth and development, are poorly understood. Little is known about the physiological and environmental control of maturation in woody plants compared with herbaceous plants, and reliable markers of phase state have only been developed for a few species, mainly conifers. Understanding the mechanisms and forms of phase change is a prerequisite for achieving maturation or rejuvenation for applications such as seed production or clonal propagation. This review describes concepts, terminology and consequences of phase change, combining theoretical and practical aspects of tree maturation that relate to clonal forestry.@@@Flowering genes

However, E. globulus is well known as a woody plant that is hard to propagate vegetatively. In this study, we found wide distribution of rooting ability among seven independent genotypes we tested. Analysis of the mechanism of adventitious rooting by using the auxin transport inhibitor, N-naphthylphthalamic acid, revealed that polar auxin transport is crucial in root formation. The gravitropism of the stem was highly correlated to the percentage of adventitious root formation. Hormonal analysis showed that the levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were the same between difficult-to-root and easy-to-root genotypes, whereas levels of IAAsp (indole-3-acetyl aspartic acid) were higher in the difficult-to-root genotype, indicating that IAA metabolism might play an important role in adventitious root formation in this species. Levels of several cytokinins exhibited differences between genotypes that varied in their cutting performance and rooting ability. Furthermore, higher level of cytokinin in elongating shoots were correlated with rooting percentage. Taken together, our results indicate that both auxins and cytokinins play a role in adventitious root formation in E. globulus, and that a complex interplay between the levels of auxins and cytokinins and their metabolism might result in root formation in this commercially important plant.@@@Eucalyptus globulus

The productivity measured as MAI increased from 29.4 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the first to 48.0 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the second rotation. Whole tree harvesting (total stem, branches and leaves) caused a 21 % reduction in volume compared to harvesting merchantable wood alone in the next rotation. The rates of nutrients accumulation in trees were highest during the first year of growth, and declined from age 2 years. Significant amounts of nutrients were recycled through litter fall from 1 year after planting. Results highlight the importance of management which promotes nutrient supply on stand growth. Removal of slash and litter lowered soil pH, by about 0.1 unit. A small reduction was also found in soil organic carbon and nitrogen in the top soil during the first 3–4 years but values returned to pre-harvest levels by the end of the rotation. Extractable soil phosphorus and exchangeable cations decreased by the end of second rotation but these measures underestimate the nutrient pools available for A. mangium. These findings along with results from other studies have helped to implement operations which promote conservation of site resources for sustainable production in the region.@@@Acacia mangium

Vegetation in this region is regularly commonly subjected to drought stress because of the geology and water shortages. Here, we investigated the influence of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Glomus mosseae and Glomus intraradices on the drought tolerance of C. glauca seedlings under greenhouse conditions. AMF-treated and non-AMF-treated C. glauca seedlings were maintained under two different water regimes (well watered: 80 % field capacity; drought stress: 40 % field capacity) for 90 days. The AMF colonization rate was higher under well-watered conditions compared to drought stress conditions. The growth and physiological performance of C. glauca seedlings were significantly affected by drought stress. Under drought stress conditions, mycorrhizal seedlings had greater height, base diameter, leaf area, and biomass compared to non-mycorrhizal seedlings. In addition, under drought conditions, AMF-inoculated seedlings had greater superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity, higher soluble sugar content, and lower proline content compared to non-inoculated seedlings. Furthermore, AMF colonization increased the phosphorus and potassium content of seedling shoots under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. Therefore, AMF colonization enhanced the drought tolerance of C. glauca seedlings by improving growth performance, nutrient content, the quantity of osmotic adjustment compounds, and antioxidant enzyme activity. The results indicate that AMF are of potential use for the restoration of vegetation in the karst region of southwest China.@@@Cyclobalanopsis glauca

Both can change over relatively short intervals in young plantations in response to silvicultural treatments and climatic conditions. Relationships to estimate leaf dry weight and leaf area of young Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden and Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) were developed from harvested trees ranging from 0.28 to 15.85 m and 0.12 to 34.4 m in height respectively. Trees were harvested from existing experiments in south-eastern Queensland and south-west Western Australia in order to assess the effects of spacing and application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer on early plantation growth. A range of tree measurements were taken to determine the most efficient way to monitor the performance of young plantation eucalyptus. Leaf weight (Wleaf, kg) and leaf area (m2) were related to stem cross sectional area at the height of the base of the green crown (SACB), but the slope and intercept of the relationship differed for trees with predominantly juvenile foliage and those with predominantly intermediate or adult foliage. Specific leaf area (m2 kg−2) changed as the trees aged and leaf area was more closely related to the size of the support structure, represented by the stem volume within the green crown, approximated by the volume of a cone above the base of the green crown (VC,gc). Significantly, the relationships also applied to individual branches, that is, leaf weight was related to sectional area near the base of the branch (SAb) and leaf area to the volume of the main (first order) branch (VC,br). Most of the published work has been directed at trees of commercial size or to small trees in pot experiments, much less to small trees in the establishment phase of growth of interest to experimenters and managers looking at early intervention. This study provides a mechanism to directly assess canopies of intermediate size trees which are of interest for assessing treatment effects or early intervention for managers.@@@Leaf area

None of these techniques is as effective as natural rejuvenation whereby the most mature plant parts, the reproductive organs, produce the most juvenile plant parts, the embryos, through gametogenesis and sexual reproduction. The most common criteria for identifying reinvigoration or rejuvenation are based on morphology, morphogenic capacity and the ability to produce cones or flowers. Doubts remain over whether true rejuvenation (reduced ontogenetic age) can be achieved by artificial methods such as serial vegetative propagation, or whether these methods merely provide reinvigoration (reduced physiological age) by temporarily removing environmental and physiological constraints to growth. Rejuvenation and reinvigoration are difficult to distinguish from each other but there is some evidence that artificial methods provide at least partial rejuvenation of plants. This review examines methods for delaying the maturation of juvenile plants and for reducing the ontogenetic or physiological age of more-mature plants. The review discusses theoretical and practical aspects of juvenility, rejuvenation and reinvigoration in clonal forestry, and identifies research areas in maturation that could lead to more-effective methods for establishing high-productivity plantations.@@@Coppicing

Don), we investigated the effects of apical and basal temperatures during a water soaking treatment on the adventitious root formation of 70-mm long shoot tip cuttings which have an apical bud. The basal portion of the cuttings was soaked for 28 days in water with temperatures ranging from 10 to 35 °C, at an air temperature of 5 or 10 °C. Control cuttings were soaked in water at 25 °C, with an air temperature of 25 °C. Treated cuttings were then planted in vermiculite rooting medium and grown at an air temperature of 25 °C for 35 days. Adventitious roots initiated earlier and developed more in the cuttings treated with apical temperatures of 5 or 10 °C and basal temperatures of 20–30 °C than in the control cuttings. The rooting percentage was greatest (93 %) in the cuttings treated with a 10/25 °C apical/basal temperature, whereas few control cuttings rooted (13 %). This suggests that the temperature gradient created by warming the basal portion of the cuttings while cooling their apical end stimulates adventitious root formation. When we tested seasonal variation of rootability at 10/25 °C, the rooting percentage increased from early autumn to winter, and decreased from winter to summer. The soluble sugar contents did not directly affect the formation of adventitious roots in the present study.@@@Bottom heat

The example study examines how climate change may affect locations in parts of South East Asia and southern China suitable for growing Acacia mangium, A. auriculiformis and A. crassicarpa. Simple descriptions of their climatic requirements are checked and, where necessary, refined. Climate data for current conditions as well as projected conditions in 2030, 2050 and 2080 are then used to map areas at a 10 min (about 18 km) resolution that are likely to have suitable climatic conditions for growing the species. Assuming a “business as usual” climate change scenario, climate change impacts are expected to be low in 2030, but likely to become medium by 2050 and high by 2080 as existing plantation sites increasingly fall outside the range of conditions known to be climatically suitable. Assessing likely impacts can help to identify plantations that are potentially most at risk, where performance should be carefully monitored to pick up early signs of any problems. The vulnerability of Acacia plantations of the three target species across the region is considered briefly in terms of the impacts of climate change and the ability of managers to adapt plantations to changing conditions.@@@Acacia mangium

Despite relatively large first-year growth differences among clones, all clones demonstrated similar responses to the treatments and clone × cutting treatment interactions were generally non-significant. The effects of changing cutting lengths are consistent with previous studies which indicated the potential for increased plant survival and growth with increased cutting lengths. Differences in stored carbohydrate reserves alone do not appear to completely control first-year growth and development of cuttings. First-year growth of 51 cm long cuttings planted 30.5 cm deep was greater than the same cuttings planted 48 cm deep. Stem form of plants derived from whip-tip propagation did not differ from plants derived from standard, unrooted cuttings. This propagation method offers the potential of far greater production capacity from a cutting orchard and rapid bulk-up of new or limited clones. Stand uniformity assessments suggest that surviving trees of each individual cutting treatment exhibit similar levels of growth variation. Optimization of plantation establishment techniques has the potential to increase growth of young Populus plantations.@@@Short-rotation woody crops

Due to the steep economic trade-offs involved and dearth of silvicultural and ecological knowledge about native flora, however, it remains unclear whether it has promise for widespread application. Focusing on growth performance, this study explores the restoration potential of twenty-one native tree species 3 years after planting in the understory of a rubber plantation in southern Bahia, Brazil. We tested the effects of slope, aspect, successional guild and basal area of the overstory rubber trees on the enriched species’ height, root collar diameter, and diameter at breast height. Height was the growth parameter that most differentiated species, with Parkia pendula, Sloanea monosperma, and Tachigali densiflora being three of the most successful species. Pioneer species grew faster than the non-pioneer species. Overstory basal area was the most important variable influencing the performance of the planted tree seedlings, while aspect and slope were less important. For every additional unit of basal area per hectare of rubber, there was an incremental decrease in the growth rates of the enrichment species. This suggests that the tree species are likely limited by available light, and that there are distinct trade-offs between overstory rubber density and understory tree species growth that are important to consider when accelerating forest recovery by using enrichment planting techniques.@@@Atlantic forest

However, there is a dearth of information on its growth and canopy development. There are also no guidelines for optimum stocking densities for practitioners to follow. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate scaling relationships between its growth in height, stem diameter and crown size and based on these relationships define stocking densities. In order to achieve this we: (1) modelled its growth in relation to plant density; (2) identified appropriate models for scaling stem height and diameter with crown size; (3) using information from step 2, we derived stocking densities under different scenarios. Crown diameter (CD) was found to scale with stem diameter (D) isometrically, while stem height scaled with CD allometrically. The scenarios derived using the CD–D scaling indicated that densities >50 plants ha−1 are untenable when DBH exceeds 40 cm. High initial densities (>625 plants ha−1) appear to lead to rapid self-thinning. Starting with low initial densities (<100 plants ha−1) was also expected to result in sub-optimal use of site resources and delayed net ecosystem production. As a compromise, we recommend establishment of stands at initial densities of about 625 trees ha−1 (or 4 m × 4 m spacing) and progressive thinning as stem diameter increases. The focus of this analysis has been on monoculture plantations of Faidherbia and the spacing may not be directly applicable where crops are integrated with trees. Therefore, we propose a follow-up study including modelling tree behaviour in mixed stands in order to refine recommendations.@@@Agroforestry

Natural regeneration of the mahoganies has been found to be far less than the rate of exploitation hence strong efforts are being made to develop other methods to regenerate mahogany seedlings to augment the low natural replacement and to ensure sustainability. This study was commissioned to investigate the effect of rooting media (river-sand, top soil and a mix of the two (50:50 v/v) on the rooting ability of four mahogany species (Khaya grandifoliola, K. ivorensis, Entandrophragma angolense and E. utile) using non-mist propagators. We investigated the effects of the source of stem cutting within a shoot (top, middle and basal position) on the rooting ability of stem cuttings from the four species in river-sand. Roots per cutting, longest root length and rooting percentage differed significantly among species in all three rooting media. Rooting ability was greatest in K. grandifoliola, which exhibited the highest average rooting percentage (73 %), longest average single root (9.9 mm) and the most roots per cutting (4.9). Rooting percentage was higher in the Khaya species than in the Entandrophragma species in all three rooting media. The mixed medium had the highest rooting percentage and the highest number of roots per rooted cutting in the two Khaya species, while the topsoil media had the best rooting percentage in the Entandrophragma species. Rooting of the two Khaya species can be maximized using a mixture of river-sand and topsoil. Cutting position within a shoot had significant impact on rooting in all four species with rooting percentage being best from middle positions in all four species. However, length of longest root and the number of roots per rooted cutting varied between the middle and basal portions. The study provides useful information for vegetative propagation of leafy stem cutting of the four African mahogany species, which could contribute to regeneration and conservation of these important timber species in the tropics.@@@Meliaceae

The results showed that (1) the area percentage (AP) of Quercusmongolica under climate change is always higher than that under the current climate regime, while the AP of Pinuskoraiensis is lower than that under current climate; and (2) the competitive ability of Q. mongolica and Populus davidiana increases, while that of other species decreases under climate change. As interspecies competition shifts under climate change, the historical reference appears in appropriate to serve as the objective of forest restoration. In addition, although Q. mongolica would likely benefit from a warmer and drier climate, use of this species for forest restoration under climate change still requires further research.@@@Forest restoration

Cloning through mini-cuttings is a new and promising technique for the production of clonal seedlings of forest species. The main objective of this work was to evaluate vegetative propagation using the mini-cutting technique and indolebutyric acid (IBA) at different concentrations (0, 3,000, 4,500, 6,000 and 7,500 mg L−1) on rooting of P. alba clones. Rooting was achieved in 98–100 % of the mini-cuttings at all concentrations tested. Increasing IBA concentration resulted in an increase in the number of leaves and leaflets, as well as in fresh matter weight and number and length of roots of clone seedlings, until an optimum point (between 3480 and 4800 mg L−1) was reached. Plants were also vegetatively propagated in the field via conventional clonal garden cuttings under the same rooting conditions to compare the efficiency of the two propagation techniques. Mini-cuttings showed higher rooting and survival percentages than cuttings. A correlation analysis conducted between characteristics of stock plants (height, diameter, number of shoots) and shoots (height, diameter) showed a positive correlation between rooting and height of shoots with total root length, leaflet number, and height of clonal seedlings. We propose the mini-cutting technique as a tool for P. alba cloning.@@@Clonal forestry

Blume (evergreen, shade intolerant) and Nothofagus alpina (P. et E.) Oerst. (deciduous, mid-tolerant to shade) seedlings established in scarified gaps in a Nothofagus old-growth forest in the Chilean Andes that was subjected to a shelterwood cut. Soils were scarified with heavy machinery that removed up to 40 cm of the upper horizons (e.g. it completely removed the litter layer and organic horizon, and in some cases partially the A horizon) to eliminate bamboo (Chusquea culeou E. Desv) shoots and rhizomes from the scarified areas. Two years after planting, seedlings were growing free of understory competition and mortality patterns were assessed using logistic regression models with the following predictor variables: (1) basal diameter growth in the prior year, and (2) soil strength measured as resistance to penetration. The probability of mortality of both species was highly predictable based on recent basal diameter growth. N. dombeyi seedlings appeared to be less affected by mortality, as reflected in lower sensitivity of mortality at lower growth rates compared to N. alpina. High values of resistance to penetration (>2,000 kPa) induced a higher probability of mortality in N. alpina (up to 40 % at 3,500 kPa). In contrast, N. dombeyi mortality was not significantly influenced by soil strength, which illustrates the more stress-resistant and pioneer character of this species. This study showed that recent growth rates can be used as a predictor of future mortality, but these relationships need to be calibrated for each species. In addition, our results suggest that species characteristics that relate to resource limitations, such as shade tolerance, are not adequate to understand effects of other stressors, such as soil disturbance, on mortality patterns.@@@Logistic regression

In such cases, species distribution models (SDM) may offer a faster and more cost effective alternative. We asked six experts to rank native tree species according to their suitability at 24 forest sites. The predictive performance of the suitability rankings was evaluated by assessing their ability to discriminate present from absent species in the observed tree assemblages at each evaluation site. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to calculate the probability that the estimated suitability for a species present at a particular evaluation site is greater than the estimate for an absent species (both picked at random). Suitability rankings were also obtained from the predictions of SDM and the same procedure was used to estimate the predictive performance of the set of models at each site. The experts offered concordant suitability rankings at almost every evaluation site. There were no significant differences in the predictive performance of the SDM and four of the experts, although the SDM performed slightly better than the other two experts. Our results point to the suitability of the proposed species distribution modeling approach to obtain fast and cost effective recommendations for species selection in forest restoration projects.@@@Ecological niche modeling

There has been increasing interest in planting and managing C. paliurus for timber production and medical use owing to loss of harvestable acreage. Seed from six provenances was collected from the main natural range of this species. Significant variation in growth and wood properties was measured among the six provenances at age 7 years. Provenance mean height and DBH varied significantly from 730–991 and 6.7–10.0 cm, whereas provenance means of wood basic density and crystallinity ranged from 463–554 kg m−3 and 51.4–74.1 %, respectively. Mean provenance microfibril angle (MFA) at breast height ranged from 18.1° to 23.2°, while MFA at breast height varied from 11.0° to 34.5° among growth rings which showed a consistent pith-to-bark trend of declining angles. There was no significant relationship of growth rate with latitude or longitude of seed sources, however, provenances from low latitude and longitude grew faster at the trial site. Wood quality was significantly related to latitude of seed sources, showing a positive correlation for both wood basic density and wood crystallinity, but a highly negative association with MFA. Significant correlations between wood properties measured indicated that there exists a great opportunity to improve wood quality of C. paliurus through selection of juvenile trees with low MFA.@@@Cyclocarya paliurus

Adaptive forest management to climate change experienced in either stable or rapidly changing environments must consider this fact when carrying out reforestation programs or specifically assisted population migration for conservation purposes. The aim of this study was to compare field performance of eleven seed sources of Aleppo pine outplanted in core and marginal habitats and to assess their phenotypic plasticity for further screening under specific conditions in particular reforestation areas. We hypothesize that current marginal habitat due to low temperature is shifting toward conditions found on the core habitat and that current core habitat will shift toward warmer and drier marginal habitat. Our study reproduced real conditions of reforestation in potential future climatic conditions. Results suggest that it is difficult to predict Aleppo pine provenances’ performance in different natural sites from their performance at a single location, even though ‘Levante interior’ and ‘La Mancha’ seed sources showed the best overall response among sites. On a site basis, provenances were matched in groups according to their survival and growth responses. Seedlings grown from local seed sources or seed orchards performed better on the core habitat. However, as conditions shifted to marginal habitats, seedlings from climatically similar regions performed better than local sources at least in the short term; our findings suggest that new plantations in areas already affected by global change could be better adapted if they use alternative seed sources.@@@Pinus halepensis

Our main objective was to take a critical look at the role of forest regrowth in mitigating the initial edge effects on microclimate and understory vegetation in northern hardwood forests of the eastern United States. We compared canopy closure, hourly air temperature, soil moisture, and understory vegetation at increasing distances from forest edges (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m) along twelve transects placed across new and older forest edges (3–4 or 16–19 years old) created by forest harvest. Open, new forest edges exhibited pronounced edge effects on microclimate and shade-intolerant plants, but these were almost completely moderated by forest regrowth on the cleared side of older edges where dense young forest developed with a new canopy comparable in cover to adjacent mature forest. There were no initial edge effects on shade-tolerant vegetation across new forest edges, but the shade-tolerant vegetation declined in mature forest near old forest edges adjacent to dense young forest that supported only sparse understory vegetation. These delayed secondary edge effects of young dense forests on adjacent mature forests have not been previously documented and they should be more explicitly included in forest management considerations. We suggest an integrated system for managing and mitigating both the immediate primary and delayed secondary edge effects in those working forest landscapes where biodiversity conservation is of high priority.@@@Biodiversity conservation

We found that large spruce seedlings can be successfully established on high-competition sites in a context where chemical herbicides cannot be used. These stock types had a limited impact on survival and growth, and both stock responded similarly to mechanical vegetation control. In this context, the choice of stock type should prioritize the highest quality large seedling based on operational considerations such as availability and ease of transportation. Mechanical site preparation was not necessary to promote seedling growth and survival on these sub-boreal sites.@@@Reforestation

"761","Cultured arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and native soil inocula improve seedling development of two pioneer trees in the Andean region@@@@@@Received: 17 March 2013 Accepted: 13 June 2014 Published: 19 June 2014 Issue Date: November 2014@@@The tree species Alnus acuminata and Morella pubescens, native to South America, are candidates for soil quality improvement and afforestation of degraded areas and may serve as nurse trees for later inter-planting of other trees, including native crop trees. Both species not only form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), but also with N2-fixing actinobacteria. Because tree seedlings inoculated with appropriate mycorrhizal fungi in the nursery resist transplanting stress better than non-mycorrhizal seedlings, we evaluated for A. acuminata and M. pubescens the potential of inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi for obtaining robust tree seedlings. For the first time, a laboratory-produced mixed AMF inoculum was tested in comparison with native soil from stands of both tree species, which contains AMF and EMF. Seedlings of both tree species reacted positively to both types of inocula and showed an increase in height, root collar diameter and above- and belowground biomass production, although mycorrhizal root colonization was rather low in M. pubescens. After 6 months, biomass was significantly higher for all mycorrhizal treatments when compared to control treatments, whereas aboveground biomass was approximately doubled for most treatments. To test whether mycorrhiza formation positively influences plant performance under reduced water supply the experiment was conducted under two irrigation regimes. There was no strong response to different levels of watering. Overall, application of native soil inoculum improved growth most. It contained sufficient AMF propagules but potentially also other soil microorganisms that synergistically enhance plant growth performance. However, the AMF inoculum pot-produced under controlled conditions was an efficient alternative for better management of A. acuminata and M. pubescens in the nursery, which in the future may be combined with defined EMF and Frankia inocula for improved management practices.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

"762","Are small-scale overstory gaps effective in promoting the development of regenerating oaks (Quercus ithaburensis) in the forest understory?@@@@@@Received: 29 December 2013 Accepted: 09 June 2014 Published: 14 June 2014 Issue Date: November 2014@@@We investigated the effect of small-scale overstory gaps on the ecophysiology and growth of Quercus ithaburensis saplings. The study aim was to characterize how changes in daily exposure to direct beam radiation affect photosynthetic performance in the short term and growth and biomass partitioning in the long term. Using individual net-houses, the following treatments were applied: (a) Unshaded (daily irradiance = 100 %), (b) shading net with no gap (Shade-daily irradiance = 6 %), (c) shading net with 1 h gap allowing direct beam radiation (11:00 am–12:00 pm, Shade+1-irradiance = 20 %), (d) shading net with 3 h gap (11:00 am–2:00 pm, Shade+3-irradiance = 44 %). The experiment was performed in an irrigated field. We measured growth, biomass allocation, leaf traits, daily courses of leaf gas exchange and water potential. Oak dry-weight increased while height to dry-weight ratio and specific leaf area decreased with increasing daily exposure to direct beam radiation. Leaf chlorophyll content was less affected. Higher net carbon assimilation rates (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and A/gs were associated with higher instantaneous photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) throughout the entire experimental PPFD range. However, during gap-hours, while exposed to saturating radiation levels of similar level (ca. 1,800 µmol photon m−2 s−1), A in the Shade+1 oaks was about half that of the Shade+3 oaks and nearly one-third that of the Unshaded oaks. Patterns of gs, intercellular CO2 (Ci) and quantum efficiency of photosystem II pointed towards the possibility of a metabolic limitation. In conclusion, oaks benefited significantly from small scale overstory gaps though their capacity to utilize transient saturating radiation levels decreased with decreasing gap duration.@@@Photosynthesis

Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium augmented with 0.2 g L−1 myo-inositol and various concentrations of either 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), naphthaleneacetic acid, or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) alone as well as combined with cytokinins was used for callus induction. The highest frequency of organogenic yellowish-white and nodular callus (93 %) was obtained from explants grown on medium supplemented with 13.5 μM 2,4-D and 4.4 μM benzyladenine (BA). The yellowish-white and nodular callus when transferred to MS medium supplemented with BA (2.2–17.7 μM) or kinetin (KT; 2.3–18.8 μM) solely or in combination with 2.3 μM 2,4-D produced several microshoots after 5 weeks culture. The calli cultured on MS medium with 4.4 μM BA singly showed superior growth response and produced both maximum shoot regeneration (94 %) and the highest mean number (4.3) of microshoots per callus. Transfer of regenerated microshoots onto modified MS basal medium fortified with 5.8 μM gibberellic acid and 4.4 μM BA resulted in the maximum number of internodes per shoot and the highest shoot elongation after a period of 6 weeks. Optimum rooting of 90 %, an average 6.1 roots per shoot, and a mean root length of 3.6 cm was observed when half-strength MS medium was supplemented with 9.8 μM IBA and 0.92 μM KT. The regenerated healthy plants with well-developed shoots and roots showed a survival rate of 77 % after acclimatization and transplanting to garden soil for a 10-week hardening period under ex vitro conditions.@@@Caspian locust

Recovery of these disturbances is highly dependent on restoration methods that encourage natural succession. Unfortunately, current reclamation protocols have resulted in soil compaction and aggressive herbaceous groundcovers that impede the recovery of native trees. To overcome this, methods such as deep ripping and plow and disking were applied to a reclaimed mine land in Ohio, USA Plantings of pure American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and two seedling types (BC1F3 and BC2F3) bred for resistance to chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) were assessed among different soil preparation treatments over five field seasons. Seedling mortality due to natural infection by chestnut blight was recorded and related to the disease resistance potential of the BC1F3 and BC2F3 seedlings. The growth and survival of chestnuts in plots that employed either ripping, plow disking, or the combination of the two methods were significantly greater than the control plots. After five seasons, differences existed among the soil treatments; plots that applied deep ripping had the highest survival and growth. When chestnut types were compared, pure American chestnut was the tallest. However, BC2F3 chestnut seedlings had the highest survival and lower disease incidence. Results suggest that employing deep ripping with backcrossed chestnut seedlings provides a method for establishing hardwood seedlings in soils impacted by surface mining. Planting methods that promote vigorous growth can be applied more broadly to other regions where anthropogenic disturbances create soil conditions that hinder seedling establishment.@@@American chestnut restoration

We examined possible relationships among soil fertility, mycorrhizas, and random patches of mosaic stunting in bareroot Pinus banksiana Lamb. and suggest this paradigm is not universal. Stunted seedlings were distributed among healthy seedlings, occupied field space for 2–3 years, and used nursery resources (i.e. irrigation, fertilization); consequently high rates of culling at harvest resulted in an economic stress for the nursery. Thus, an understanding of the cause(s) of stunting was necessary. Stunted 1 + 0 seedlings had significantly lower levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc than their healthy cohorts, despite similar soil nutrient levels. The numbers of mycorrhizal root tips on stunted and healthy seedlings were similar, and the taxa of mycorrhizal fungi, determined by isolations and DNA sequencing, were not consistently associated with stunted or healthy seedlings. We conclude that differences in Pinus banksiana mycorrhizas are not responsible for mosaic stunting, but may be caused by localized low soil N availability due to uneven distribution of added organic matter amendments.@@@Mycorrhizas

Here we performed experiments in phytotron using 2-year-old Ginkgo seedlings to explore the effects of temperature and soil moisture on flavonoids content, enzymes related to flavonoids biosynthesis such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and p-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL), soluble sugar and protein content. We found that temperature and lower soil moisture had significant effects on these parameters. The effects of temperature on flavonoids content, the activity of C4H and 4CL and soluble sugar content were greater than that of soil moisture. The total flavonoid content, the activity of PAL, C4H and 4CL, soluble sugar content were higher in lower temperature regime 15 °C (daytime)/5 °C (nighttime) and lower soil moisture (30–35 % of field capacity), but higher temperature was beneficial to the accumulation of soluble protein. This indicates that increasing of soluble sugar content and the activity of PAL, C4H and 4CL are beneficial to flavonoids biosynthesis and accumulation in the Ginkgo leaves, while increasing of soluble protein is adverse to flavonoids biosynthesis. Because lower temperature and soil moisture are favorable to flavonoids biosynthesis, we can take some silvicultural steps to increase flavonoids production in Ginkgo plantation, such as establishing leaf-harvest plantation at lower temperature zone, reducing irrigating before harvesting leaves.@@@Ginkgo biloba L.

This is particularly important in regions characterized by long periods of drought and soil erosion, such as the Bolivian Andes, where agroforestry with native woody species is rarely applied. Better knowledge on the effects of environmental stress on propagation and establishment of such native plants is needed to optimize their cultivation. In our study, we tested the effects of temperature and scarification on seed germination, and assessed seedling survival and juvenile growth of two potential agroforestry species (Prosopis laevigata var. andicola, Schinus molle) under diverse soil and water conditions. Temperatures above 30 °C accelerated germination, but they increased fungi infestation in the case of S. molle. The application of acid and mechanical scarification significantly improved the germination capacity of P. laevigata var. andicola. Medium to high moisture levels in sand provided the most favourable conditions for plant growth. S. molle was more sensitive to dry and P. laevigata var. andicola more vulnerable to water-saturated clay loam. Mulching enhanced the survival and growth of S. molle juveniles, but increased P. laevigata var. andicola’s growth in sand and dry soils only. Our results may facilitate guidance on improving propagation of these two potential agroforestry species under environmental stress conditions. More generally, our study shows that easily applicable treatments, such as mulching, can significantly improve the cultivation of native species, provided that their habitat requirements and limiting factors are well known. This highlights the relevance of identifying and closing such knowledge gaps for native trees and shrubs in order to promote their potential for use in agroforestry.@@@Native woody species

Here, we analyzed the growth, flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content, flavonols yield per plant, and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes in 2-year Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) seedlings at four different light intensities (100, 76, 40, and 25 % of full sunlight) in a greenhouse setting. Across all light intensities, the 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest growth of total biomass, root, stem, and leaf, indicating negative effects of either fulllight or heavy shading on Ginkgo seedling development. Both flavonols (total flavonol, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) content and expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes [PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), CHS (Chalcone synthase), F3H (Flavanone 3-hydroxylase), and FLS (Flavonol synthase)] in leaves were highest under 100 % sunlight, suggesting that full sunlight promotes the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes and increases flavonoid biosynthesis. The highest and lowest flavonol contents were found in leaves and stems, respectively. The 76 % sunlight treatment produced the highest flavonols yield while the 100 % sunlight produced the highest flavonoids content in leaves, indicating that flavonol production per unit land area depends not only flavonol content but also biomass. Overall, in order to achieve the highest flavonols yield per area in Ginkgo leaf-harvesting plantations, it is important to manipulate light conditions of field.@@@Ginkgo biloba

We compared their ability to predict in-hospital mortality among cholecystectomized patients using a Spanish large database of 87 hospitals during the period 2008-2010.

Methods: The electronic healthcare database Minimal Basic Data Set (MBDS) contain information of diseases, conditions, procedures and demographic data of patients attended in hospital setting. We used available information to calculate CCI and ECI, and analyzed their relation to in-hospital mortality.

Results: The models including age, gender, tobacco use disorders, hospital size and CCI or ECI were predictive of in-hospital mortality among cholecystectomized patients, when measured in terms of adjusted Odds Ratios and 95% confidence limits. There was a dose-effect relationship between score of prognostic indexes and risk of death. Area under the curve for ROC predictive models for in-hospital mortality were 0.8717 for CCI and 0.8771 for ECI, but differences were not statistically significant (p> 10− 6).

Conclusion: Both CCI and ECI were predictive of in-hospital mortality among cholecystectomized patients in a large sample of Spanish patients after controlling for age, gender, group of hospital and tobacco use disorders. The availability of more hospitals databases through Big Data can strengthen the external validity of these results if we control several threats of internal validity such as biases and missing values.

Social Tagging systems such as BibSonomy and del.icio.us have become progressively popular with the widespread use of the internet. The social tagging system is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 resources. Social tagging systems allow users to annotate web resources with free-form tags. Tags are widely used to interpret and classify the web 2.0 resources. Tag clustering is the process of grouping the similar tags into clusters. The tag clustering is very useful for searching and organizing the web2.0 resources and also important for the success of social tagging systems. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social bookmarking websites. So, instead of clustering the entire tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. In this chapter, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and this paper proposes TRS approach hybridized with Meta heuristic clustering algorithms. The proposed approaches are Hybrid TRS and K-Means Clustering (TRS-K-Means), Hybrid TRS and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) K-Means clustering algorithm (TRS-PSO-KMeans), and Hybrid TRS-PSO-K-Means-Genetic Algorithm (TRS-PSO-GA). These intelligent approaches automatically determine the number of clusters. These are in turn compared with K-Means benchmark algorithm for Social Tagging System.

This increase has compelled data users to find automatic means of looking into databases to bring out vital information. Retrieving information from ‘Big data’, (as it is often referred to) can be likened to finding ‘a needle in the haystack’. It is worthy of note that while big data has several computational challenges, it also serves as gateway to technological preparedness in making the world a global village. Social media sites (of which Twitter is one) are known to be big data collectors as well as an open source for information retrieval. Easy access to social media sites and the advancement of technology tools such as the computer and smart devices have made it convenient for different entities to store enormous data in real time. Twitter is known to be the most powerful and most popular microbloging tool in social media. It offers its users the opportunity of posting and receiving instantaneous information from the network. Traditional news media follow the activities on Twitter network in order to retrieve interesting tweets that can be used to enhance their news reports and news updates. Twitter users include hashtags symbols (#) as prefix to keywords used in tweets to describe its content and to enhance the readability of their tweets. This chapter uses the Apriori method for Association Rule Mining (ARM) and a novel methodology termed Rule Type Identification-Mapping (RTI-Mapping) which is inherited from Transaction-based Rule Change Mining TRCM (Adedoyin-Olowe et al., 2013) and Transaction-based Rule Change Mining-Rule Type Identification (TRCM-RTI) (Gomes et al., 2013) to map Association Rules (ARs) detected in tweets’ hashtags to evolving news reports and news updates of traditional news agents in real life. TRCM uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to analyse tweets on the same topic over consecutive periods t and t + 1 using Rule Matching (RM) to detected changes in ARs such as emerging, unexpected, new and dead rules. This is obtained by setting user-defined Rule Matching Threshold (RMT) to match rules in tweets at time t with those in tweets at t + 1 in order to ascertain rules that fall into the different patterns. TRCM-RTI is a methodology built from TRCM, it identifies rule types of evolving ARs present in tweets’ hashtags at different time periods. This chapter adopts RTI-Mapping from methodologies in (Adedoyin-Olowe et al., 2013) and (Gomes et al., 2013) to map ARs with online evolving news of top traditional news agents in order to detect and track news and news updates of evolving events. This is an initial experiment of ARs mapping to evolving news. The mapping is done manually at this stage and the methodology is validated using four events and news topics as case studies. The experiments show substantial result on the selected news topics.

Recent advances in future generation sequencing technologies have resulted in a tremendous raise in the rate of that protein sequence data are being obtained. Big Data analysis is a clear bottleneck in many applications, especially in the field of bio-informatics, because of the complexity of the data that needs to be analyzed. Protein sequence analysis is a significant problem in functional genomics. Proteins play an essential role in organisms as they perform many important tasks in their cells. In general, protein sequences are exhibited by feature vectors. A major problem of protein dataset is the complexity of its analysis due to their enormous number of features. Feature selection techniques are capable of dealing with this high dimensional space of features. In this chapter, the new feature selection algorithm that combines the Improved Harmony Search algorithm with Rough Set theory for Protein sequences is proposed to successfully tackle the big data problems. An Improved harmony search (IHS) algorithm is a comparatively new population based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. This approach imitates the music improvisation process, where each musician improvises their instrument’s pitch by seeking for a perfect state of harmony and it overcomes the limitations of traditional harmony search (HS) algorithm. An Improved Harmony Search hybridized with Rough Set Quick Reduct for faster and better search capabilities. The feature vectors are extracted from protein sequence database, based on amino acid composition and K-mer patterns or K-tuples and then feature selection is carried out from the extracted feature vectors. The proposed algorithm is compared with the two prominent algorithms, Rough Set Quick Reduct and Rough Set based PSO Quick Reduct. The experiments are carried out on protein primary single sequence data sets that are derived from PDB on SCOP classification, based on the structural class predictions such as all α, all β, all α + β and all α/ β. The feature subset of the protein sequences predicted by both existing and proposed algorithms are analyzed with the decision tree classification algorithms.

This factor is crucial to ensure the success of any cross-enterprise integration applications, business intelligence or data mining solutions. Detecting duplicate data that represent the same real world object more than once in a certain dataset is the first step to ensure the data accuracy. This operation becomes more complicated when the same object name (person, city) is represented in multiple natural languages due to several factors including spelling, typographical and pronunciation variation, dialects and special vowel and consonant distinction and other linguistic characteristics. Therefore, it is difficult to decide whether or not two syntactic values (names) are alternative designation of the same semantic entity. Up to authors’ knowledge, the previously proposed duplicate record detection (DRD) algorithms and frameworks support only single language duplicate record detection, or at most bilingual. In this paper, two available tools of duplicate record detection are compared. Then, a generic cross language based duplicate record detection solution architecture is proposed, designed and implemented to support the wide range variations of several languages. The proposed system design uses a dictionary based on phonetic algorithms and support different indexing/blocking techniques to allow fast processing. The framework proposes the use of several proximity matching algorithms, performance evaluation metrics and classifiers to suit the diversity in several languages names matching. The framework is implemented and verified empirically in several case studies. Several Experiments are executed to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed system compared to other tool. Results showed that the proposed system has substantial improvements compared to the well-known tools.

These massive data gathered as continuous flow, are often accompanied by dire need for real-time processing. One aspect of data streams deals with storage management and processing of continuous queries for aggregation. Another significant aspect pertains to discovery and understanding of hidden patterns to derive actionable knowledge using mining approaches. This chapter focuses on stream clustering and presents a primer of clustering algorithms in data stream environment.

Clustering of data streams has gained importance because of its ability to capture natural structures from unlabeled, non-stationary data. Single scan of data, bounded memory usage, and capturing data evolution are the key challenges during clustering of streaming data. We elaborate and compare the algorithms on the basis of these constraints. We also propose a taxonomy of algorithms based on the fundamental approaches used for clustering. For each approach, a systematic description of contemporary, well-known algorithms is presented. We place special emphasis on synopsis data structure used for consolidating characteristics of streaming data and feature it as an important issue in design of a stream clustering algorithms. We argue that a number of functional and operational characteristics (e.g. quality of clustering, handling of outliers, number of parameters etc.) of a clustering algorithm are influenced by the choice of synopsis. A summary of clustering features that are supported by different algorithms is given. Finally, research directions for improvement in the usability of stream clustering algorithms are suggested.

In these spaces, the performance of models is commonly highly variable and dependent on the target error estimators, data regularities and model properties. High-variable performance is a common problem in the analysis of omics data, healthcare data, collaborative filtering data, and datasets composed by features extracted from unstructured data or mapped from multi-dimensional databases. In these contexts, assessing the statistical significance of the performance guarantees of models learned from these high-dimensional spaces is critical to validate and weight the increasingly available scientific statements derived from the behavior of these models. Therefore, this chapter surveys the challenges and opportunities of evaluating models learned from big data settings from the less-studied angle of big dimensionality. In particular, we propose a methodology to bound and compare the performance of multiple models. First, a set of prominent challenges is synthesized. Second, a set of principles is proposed to answer the identified challenges. These principles provide a roadmap with decisions to: i) select adequate statistical tests, loss functions and sampling schema, ii) infer performance guarantees from multiple settings, including varying data regularities and learning parameterizations, and iii) guarantee its applicability for different types of models, including classification and descriptive models. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to provide a robust and flexible assessment of distinct types of models sensitive to both the dimensionality and size of data. Empirical evidence supports the relevance of these principles as they offer a coherent setting to bound and compare the performance of models learned in high-dimensional spaces, and to study and refine the behavior of these models.

The synthesis of novel methods is performed by selected evolutionary algorithms and demonstrated on the astrophysical data sets. Such approach is now characteristic for so called Big Data and Big Analytics. First, we describe some new database architectures that support Big Data storage and processing. We also discuss selected Big Data issues, specifically the data sources, characteristics, processing, and analysis. Particular interest is devoted to parallelism in the service of data processing and we discuss this topic in detail. We show how new technologies encourage programmers to consider parallel processing not only in a distributive way (horizontal scaling), but also within each server (vertical scaling). The chapter also intensively discusses interdisciplinary intersection between astrophysics and computer science, which has been denoted astroinformatics, including a variety of data sources and examples. The last part of the chapter is devoted to selected bio-inspired methods and their application on simple model synthesis from astrophysical Big Data collections. We suggest a method how new algorithms can be synthesized by bio-inspired approach and demonstrate its application on an astronomy Big Data collection. The usability of these algorithms along with general remarks on the limits of computing are discussed at the conclusion of this chapter.

One of the common approaches to satisfy performance need and preserve relational integrity, is a correctly designed and implemented decentralized database. IT systems migration from centralized to distributed database may imply heavy costs including review of existing systems core and interfaces. Also, an incongruous design may be fatal in Big Data processing systems such as data loss due to completeness rule break. A simple field replication may be acceptable in “normal size” databases, but will result to significant storage space waste. Indeed, marketed DDBMS are currently very far from automated support for the large distributed data. This heavy task is always done without any GUI or a friendly assistance that insures distribution rules (completeness, disjointness and reconstruction). Moreover, database transparency still not automatically ensured even with reported distribution script. Data treatment stored procedures and functions must take in consideration the distributed context. This context switch may result to re-writing the complete algorithm of data treatment. The aim of this paper is to propose a new architecture for the description and manipulation of Large Distributed Data. The result of this approach is a distribution context aware tool that respects database distribution rules and helps designers to easily create reliable DDB scripts. To avoid the core application and interfaces review, an automated translator from centralized format queries to distribution context aware queries. Even after the migration, end-users and application will see the distributed database as it was before splitting. This level of transparency is guaranteed by the queries translator.

Most of the pattern reorganization techniques involve significantly large amounts of computation and processing time for extracting the features and classification. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the P, QRS, T wave demonstrating the electrical activity of the heart. Electrocardiogram is the most straightforwardly accessible bioelectric signal that provides the doctors with reasonably accurate data regarding the patient’s heart disorder. Many of the cardiac problems are visible as distortions in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Different heart diseases are with different ECG wave shapes; in addition, there is large numbers of heart illnesses, so it is hard to accurately extract cardiology features from diverse ECG wave forms. Big Data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including physical, bio-medical and social sciences. It is used to build computational models directly from large ECG data sets. Rough set rule generation is specifically designed to extract human understandable decision rules from nominal data. Soft rough set theory is a new mathematical tool to deal uncertainty. Five types of rhythm including Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) and Paced Rhythm (PR) are obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Five morphological features are extracted from each beat after the preprocessing of the selected records. In this chapter, the ECG signals were classified using Modified soft rough set technique. The empirical analysis shows that the proposed method shows better performance compared to the other six established techniques like Back Propagation Neural Network, Decision table, J48, JRip, Multilayer Perceptron and Naive Bayes. This chapter is focused on finding an easy but reliable features and best MSR structure to correctly classify five different cardiac conditions.

This spectacular growth of data is at the origin of what is called the Big Data. As several fields are affected by digitization, the medical field has experienced in the past years, an important technological and digital revolution, which contributed to a large informational explosion of digital medical data. In addition to their massive quantity, these data are also characterized by the complexity, diversity and heterogeneity, and they are often contained in the so-called the Electronic Health Record (EHR). However, not having the right tools to explore the large amounts of data that have been collected because of their potential usefulness, the data becomes unnecessary and databases and their management systems become without advantage. In this context, we propose in this paper the Medical Multi-project ICOP system (M2ICOP) which was an interactive system dedicated particularly to clinicians and researchers in the medical field to help them explore, visualize and analyze a set of medical data really large and heterogeneous. Practically, our system allows these users to visualize and interact with a large number of electronic health records, and the search of similar EHRs and the comparison between them to take advantage of best practices and shared experiences to improve the quality of treatment.

With the exponential growth of data, companies now face unprecedented challenges, however are also presented with numerous opportunities for competitive growth. Advancement in data capturing devices and the existence of multi-generation systems in organizations have increased the number of data sources. Typically, data generated from different devices may not be compatible with each other, which calls for data integration. Although, ETL market offers a wide variety of tools for data integration, it is still common for companies to use SQL to manually produce in-house ETL tools. There are technological and managerial challenges to deal with data integration. During data integration, data quality must be embedded in it.

Big data analytics delivers insights which can be used for effective business decisions. However, some of these insights may invade consumer privacy. With more and more data related to consumer behavior being collected and the advancement in big data analytics, privacy has become an increasing concern. Therefore, it is necessary to address issues related to privacy laws, consumer protections and best practices to safeguard privacy. In this chapter, we will discuss topics related to big data in the area of big data integration, big data quality, big data privacy, and big data analytics.

The signigicant capabilities of current semantic technology allow the implementation of rich data models according to an ontological approach that assures competitive interoperable solutions in the context of environments for general purpose (e.g. the Semantic Web) as well as inside more specific systems (e.g. Geographic Information Systems). Extended capabilities in terms of expressivity have strong implications also for data/information processing, especially on a large scale (Big Data). Semantic spaces can play a critical role in those processes contrasting the mostly passive role of models simply reflecting a geographic perspective. This chapter proposes a short overview of a simple model for semantic geographic space and a number of its applications, mostly focusing on the added value provided by the use of semantic spaces in different use cases.

Electrocardiogram datasets are generally called as big data. Big Data are the group of huge volumes of unstructured data. Big Data means enormous amounts of data, such large that it is difficult to collect, store, manage, analyze, predict, visualize, and model the data. Electrocardiography deals with the electrical movement of the heart. The order of cardiac health is given by ECG and heart rate. A study of the nonlinear dynamics of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for arrhythmia characterization is considered in this work. Cardiac problems are considered to be the most deadly disease in medical world. Cardiac arrhythmia is abnormality of heart rhythm, in fact refers to disorder in electrical conduction system of the heart. In this paper, computerized ECG interpretations are used to identify arrhythmias. It is a process of ECG signal acquisition, eliminating noise (De-noising) from ECG signal, detecting wave parameters (P, Q, R, S and T) and rhythm classification. Substantial progress has been made over the years in improvising techniques for signal conditioning, extraction of relevant wave parameters and rhythm classification. However, many problems and issues, especially those related to detection of multiple arrhythmic events using soft computing techniques is still need to be addressed in a broader manner to improve the prospect of commercial automated arrhythmia analysis in mass health care centres. The main objective of this paper is to present a classifier system based on Bijective soft set in order to classify ECG signal data into five classes (Normal, Left bundle branch blocks, Right bundle branch blocks, premature ventricular contractions and Paced rhythm class). To complete this objective, an algorithm for detection of P, QRS and T waves are applied followed by IBISOCLASS Classifier. The experimental results are acquired by examining the proposed method on ECG data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed algorithm is also compared with the well-known standard classification algorithms namely Back propagation network (BPN), Decision table, J48 and Naïve Bayes.

We retrospectively evaluated its ability to predict sickness absence, hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality among 1,826,190 workers followed during the period 2007-2009.

Methods: The electronic administrative databases DIRAYA© and MBDS contain information of diseases and conditions of patients attended in primary care and hospital settings, respectively. We retrospectively used available information in the DIRAYA medical record database to calculate CCI adapted to PC (CCIPC), and analyzed its relation to sickness absence, hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality.

Results: The models including age, gender, province of residence, hospital size and CCIPC calculated in PC setting were predictive of every outcome: sick leave (their number and duration), hospital admissions (number and length of hospital stays) and in-hospital mortality, when measured in terms of adjusted Odds Ratios and 95% confidence limits. Area under the curve for ROC predictive models was maximal for in-hospital mortality (0.9254).

Conclusion: The adapted CCIPC was predictive of all outcomes related to sick leave, hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality among a large sample of Spanish workers. If the goal is to compare outcomes across centers and regions for specific diseases and causes of sickness absence, CCIPC is a promising option worthy of prospective testing. The future availability of information through Big Data can increase the external validity of these results if at the same time biases that threaten the internal validity of the results are avoided.

From all of these sources massive or big data is generated and gathered for finding the useful patterns. The amount of data is growing at the enormous rate, the analyst forecast that the expected global big data storage to grow at the rate of 31.87% over the period 2012-2016, thus the storage must be highly scalable as well as flexible so the entire system doesn’t need to be brought down to increase storage. In order to store and access the massive data the storage hardware and network infrastructure is required.

Cloud computing can be viewed as one of the most viable technology for handling the big data and providing the infrastructure as services and these services should be uninterrupted. This computing is one of the cost effective technique for storage and analysis of big data.

Cloud computing and Massive data are the two rapidly evolving technologies in the modern day business applications. Lot of hope and optimism are surrounding around these technologies because analysis of massive or big data provides better insight into the data that may create competitive advantage and generates data related innovations having tremendous potential to revive the business bottom lines. Tradition ICT (information and communication) technology is inadequate and illequipped to handle terabytes or petabytes of data whereas cloud computing promises to hold unlimited, on-demand, elastic computing and data storage resources without huge upfront investments that is otherwise required when setting up traditional data centers. These two technologies are on converging paths and the combinations of the two technologies are proving powerful when it comes to perform analytics. At the same time, cloud computing platforms provide massive scalability, 99.999% reliability, high performance, and specifiable configurability. These capabilities are provided at relatively low cost compared to dedicated infrastructures.

There is an element of over enthusiasm and unrealistic expectations with regard to the use and future of these technologies. This chapter draws attention towards the challenges and risks involved in the use and implementation of these naive technologies. Downtime, data privacy and security, scarcity of big data analysts, validity and accuracy of the emerged data pattern and many more such issues need to be carefully examined before switching from legacy data storage infrastructure to the cloud storage. The chapter elucidates the possible tradeoffs between storing the data using legacy infrastructure and the cloud. It is emphasizes that cautious and selective use of big data and cloud technologies is advisable till these technologies matures.

In this study, we conducted a benefit–cost analysis of an ongoing, first generation, 6.5 ha white spruce clonal seed orchard, established in 1985–1987 in Lower Queensbury, New Brunswick. This seed orchard has provided seed for reforestation on Crown lands in the province since 1993. The analysis was undertaken by evaluating the present values of relative costs, benefits, and benefit/cost ratios (BCRs) associated with a plantation management strategy that uses the Lower Queensbury clonal seed orchard (LQ_CSO) versus one that uses wild stand (unselected) seeds. Cash flows were based on actual costs for the LQ_CSO (including orchard establishment and management, progeny test establishment and maintenance, and data analysis), and projected revenue increases from the genetic gains associated with the LQ_CSO relative to the unselected seedlot. Genetic gains at rotation ages were predicted using a growth and yield model that used 20-year old data collected from a realized gain test, and considered two rotation ages (40 and 50 years) along with two management scenarios (with vs. without commercial thinning). A number of discount rates (from 4 to 8 %) were also assessed. Findings indicated that the BCRs ranged from 12.5 to 0.4, depending on the scenario considered, with a majority being >1. BCRs increased when commercial thinning was applied, but declined marginally when the rotation age was extended from 40 to 50 years. Overall, the results demonstrated that the establishment of the LQ_CSO was an excellent investment for all scenarios when the discount rate was <6 %.@@@Tree improvement

In Experiment 1, cone yields were greater using stem girdles plus stem injections of GA4/7 compared to girdling alone, root pruning, and girdling plus fertilization with Ca(NO3)2. In Experiment 2, topping and pruning in the summer following flower stimulation minimized crown volume and maximized female and male flower densities. In Experiment 3, the widest spaced orchard (4 × 6 m) generally produced more flowers and cones per tree, and greater flower and cone densities compared to the narrow spaced orchards (1 × 3 and 2 × 4 m). We conclude that narrow spaced MSOs may produce more cones per hectare in the early years after establishment, but wider spaced orchards will be more productive a few years later. In general, per-hectare cone yields were similar or greater in the MSOs compared to nearby conventionally spaced orchards. Trees grafted using scions collected from juvenile trees (age 6) generally had larger crowns, more female flowers and cones per tree, and greater female flower and cone densities compared to scions collected from middle-aged (age 29) or mature (56- to 99-year-old) trees. We found no evidence that clonal rows resulted in reduced seed quality relative to nearby conventional orchards. Implications for Douglas-fir seed orchard management are discussed.@@@Flowering

This study determined whether rooting capacity and cutting vigour varied along the central shoot of Corymbia seedlings, and whether these differences are related to stem development and hormone concentrations. Dual-node cuttings were harvested from five positions (nodes 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 and 9/10) along the seedling shoot (S1), and cuttings were treated with one of four levels of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Root formation, root and shoot growth, stem anatomy, and the concentrations of indole-3-acetic (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were assessed at each shoot position. The central node of the rooted cuttings was harvested for fresh cuttings to observe whether maturation emerged in ramets (S2) from the different ortet positions. Rooting and vigour were highest from the most-apical seedling nodes (7/8 and 9/10 in S1), which had less lignification and sclerenchyma development than more-basal nodes (1/2, 3/4 and 5/6). IAA and ABA concentrations differed little between the seedling nodes. In contrast, cuttings from the ramets (in S2) had similar rooting, vigour, lignification and sclerification to each other, but there were large differences in IAA and ABA concentrations depending on their previous point-of-origin in the seedling. High doses of IBA reduced rooting. Rooting and vigour were related to lignification and sclerenchyma development rather than IAA or ABA concentrations. Mass vegetative propagation of C. torelliana × C. citriodora is achievable because mean rooting percentages in S1 and S2 were 61 and 68 %, respectively, using cuttings from small seedling ortets and their ramets.@@@Adventitious roots

We argue that China’s state-owned forestry sector has low land productivities mainly because there are hidden barriers in the governmentally controlled forestry system. We suggest that a market-oriented forestry system should be applied to China’s commercial forests, and timber harvesting from commercial forests should not be restricted by a maximum allowable harvest quota or minimum rotation lengths imposed by the national government. The market-oriented forestry system will help increase forestland productivity and revert forest carbon sources into sinks for many degraded forest areas in China.@@@Commercial forest

The results showed that cutting length, diameter, and the interaction between cutting length and diameter significantly affected rooting efficiency. Higher rooting efficiency was obtained by cuttings of 0.3–0.4 cm diameter and 9–12 cm length. Hormone type significantly affected all measured rooting traits, and moderately higher measurements were observed in the indole butyric acid treatment than those of the control, whereas all measurements in the α-naphthalene acetic acid treatment were significantly lower than those of the control, which may have been an inhibitor of Picea abies in stem cuttings. The cutting size effect on rooting efficiency is discussed and an optimal cutting size is suggested, which provide valuable information for propagating Norway spruce.@@@Picea abies

We surveyed the understory woody vegetation growing in 7-year-old stands of T. grandis and the native tree species Terminalia amazonia in a plantation in western Panama that was managed with both commercial timber and biodiversity conservation objectives. We predicted that if T. grandis suppressed forest regeneration then the understories of T. grandis stands would have a lower density of woody stems, smaller stems, and fewer species than stands of T. amazonia. None of our predictions were supported. Densities of woody stems were 0.56 ± 0.21 m−2 (mean ± SE) and 0.64 ± 0.10 m−2 in T. grandis and T. amazonia understories, respectively. Stem height structure was similar under both species, where stems <1 m height dominated. Understory species richness did not differ between the two species; in total, 27 and 30 woody species were sampled in T. grandis and T. amazonia stands, respectively. However, understory species composition differed between the two crop species. Overall, our results are inconsistent with the idea that T. grandis plantations suppress forest regeneration and suggest that the lack of woody vegetation in other T. grandis plantation understories may be attributable to management actions, such as understory thinning, rather than species effects of T. grandis. Further research is needed to compare T. grandis and native species for their effects on forest regeneration.@@@Diversity

We combined eddy covariance (EC) techniques and fuel consumption plots to examine the short-term response of longleaf pine forest carbon dynamics to one prescribed fire at the ends of an edaphic gradient (mesic and xeric sites). We also introduce novel (to the EC research community) statistical time-series approaches to quantify the drivers of carbon dynamics in these systems. We determined that our mesic site was a moderate sink of carbon (−157.7 ± 25.1 g C m−2 year−1), while the xeric site was carbon neutral (5.9 ± 32.8 g C m−2 year−1) during the study. The fire released 408 and 153 g C m−2 year−1 for the mesic and xeric sites, respectively. When loss associated with fire was combined with net ecosystem exchange rates, both sites became moderate carbon sources for the year. Analyses of assimilation and respiration parameters (e.g., maximum photosynthesis, quantum efficiency, and daytime ecosystem respiration) showed a positive trend over time pre-fire and a negative trend over time post-fire for maximum ecosystem CO2 uptake rates, and the opposite relationship for daytime ecosystem respiration rates. Within 30 days following fire, ecosystem physiological activity was statistically similar to pre-fire and appeared to be driven by the pine canopy. Our results suggest that prescribed fire (low intensity, high frequency) maintains the existing structure and function (in this case, carbon flux rates) because longleaf pine ecosystems have evolved with fire. This study, 1 year in length, provides a foundational understanding of the complex interaction between fire and carbon dynamics for longleaf pine ecosystems. Moreover, it provides a case study for applying time series analysis methods to EC data where there are complex relationships between ecosystem physiological activity and environmental drivers. However, to elicit a broader understanding of the complex interaction occurring between fire and carbon dynamics long- term studies are needed.@@@Longleaf pine

However, previous studies have partly considered the effects of insect infestations on animal seed dispersal and subsequent plant regeneration. In this study, we tested whether the effects of insect infestations on seed dispersal were frequency dependent (i.e., ratio of noninfested to infested acorns). We tracked the seed dispersal of plastic-tagged noninfested and insect-infested Q. aliena var. acuteserrata acorns with different frequencies in the Qinling Mountains in central China. Our results demonstrated that noninfested acorns were removed more rapidly, regardless of the infestation rates. Insect-infested acorns were also more likely to be eaten in situ, whereas noninfested acorns were more likely to be scatter-hoarded independent of infestation rates. Moreover, noninfested acorns were dispersed further and had higher survival rates than insect-infested acorns. Our findings suggest that the seed dispersal advantages of noninfested acorns compared with infested acorns was not frequency dependent, thereby indicating a consistently higher dispersal likelihood of noninfested acorns.@@@Frequency dependent

One trial included six Spanish populations, with two subpopulations corresponding to wild and orchard trees distinguished within each population, and 77 open-pollinated families. The second trial encompassed six European populations and 156 open-pollinated families. Differences between populations were highly significant for phenological, growth, and form traits, and changes in the ranking of some populations were found for growth traits over the years of the study. Significant differences in survival were reported for the first time. Observed geographic variation among chestnut populations confirmed that drought is an important factor in determining traits related to growth and phenology. Significant differences among families were detected for all traits except for survival. Estimated individual heritabilities ranged from 0.21 to 0.43 for flushing, 0.16 to 0.37 for growth traits and straightness, 0.12 to 0.17 for bud set, and 0.08 to 0.24 for apical dominance. Significant, moderate genetic correlations were observed between growth and form traits, apical dominance and straightness, and flushing and bud set. On the basis of volume and form traits, the best trees of the best families within the best-adapted populations were selected for their inclusion in main and elite Galician breeding populations.@@@Castanea sativa

In a South African breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens, various scenarios investigating a range of assumptions were developed and used to predict genetic gain in the F2. These were compared with realised gains achieved in a series of genetic gain trials. In the two scenarios using firstly, actual flowering for family (provenance) and, secondly, estimated flowering after 30 % roguing of poor families, a coefficient of relationship of 0.33 resulted in predictions closest to realised gain, on average. The statistical information suggested that outcrossing in the seed orchards was >80 %. Indications were that the effects were additive, and that very little or no heterosis had occurred, due to the still significant provenance effects and the lack of provenance rank changes in the F2. The custom of assuming a degree of inbreeding (and using a coefficient of relationship of 0.33) and of including provenance effects in the models, on average resulted in genetic gain predictions which were very similar to the realised genetic gains in this population of E. nitens.@@@E. nitens

Two alternative models were developed: a full model, considering all available explanatory variables, and a reduced model, considering only variables that can be obtained without digging a soil pit. The reduced model was used for mapping the site index distribution in Portugal, on the basis of existing digital cartography available for the whole country. The developed models indicate the importance of water availability and soil water holding capacity for site index value distribution. Site index was related to climate, namely evaporation and frost, and soil characteristics such as lithology, soil texture, soil depth, thickness of the A horizon and soil classification. The variability of the estimated values within the map (9.5–16.8 m with an average value of 13.4 m) reflects the impact of soil characteristics on the site productivity estimation. These variables should be taken into consideration during the establishment of new plantations of cork oak, and management of existing plantations. Results confirm the potential distribution of cork oak in coastal regions. They also suggest the existence of a considerable area, located both North and South of the Tagus river, where site indices values of medium (]13;15]) to high (]15;17]) productivity classes may be expected. The species is then expected to be able to have good productivity along the northern coastal areas of Portugal, where presently it is not a common species but where, according to historical records, it occurred until the middle of the sixteenth century. The present research focused on tree growth. Cork growth and cork quality distribution needs to be further researched through the establishment of long term experimental sites along the distribution area of cork oak, namely in the central and northern coastal areas of the country.@@@Quercus suber L.

The objectives of this study were to describe (1) the loss of DT in Senna multijuga seeds during hydration under different conditions and (2) the storage behavior of dry seeds and germinating seeds after desiccation. Seeds lose DT progressively as germination advances, and DT is totally lost before the radicle protrudes. Soaked seeds maintained DT for a longer period of time in comparison to imbibed seeds. Dry seeds tolerated storage even at sub-zero temperatures; however, when germinating seeds were dehydrated, the storability at sub-zero temperatures was reduced. Storage of dried germinating seeds at sub-zero temperature reduced germination and increased the proportion of abnormal seedlings. The hydration conditions changed seed response to desiccation, and this result may be related to differences in metabolism. Thus, the conditions in which seeds remain during hydration can affect the physiological response of seeds, and when studies are conducted to assess the DT, this fact should be taken into consideration. According to the results of this study, S. multijuga seeds can be classified as orthodox; however, storage at sub-zero temperatures is harmful to germinating seeds after drying. Thus, for successful long-term storage, although the current water content of the seeds is important, if the seeds are previously hydrated (and then dried), this will affect seed storability, with consequent implications for ex situ conservation.@@@Hydration

Using short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) for nutrient uptake and biomass production might be an inexpensive and eco-friendly method for the stabilization of decommissioned lagoons. We evaluated the annual growth performance and nutrient uptake by sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) for five growing seasons and 25 different clones of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) for four growing seasons in a soil backfilled, de-watered swine lagoon in north-central Oklahoma. Growth performance and nutrient uptake of cottonwood was higher than the sycamore in our study. At the end of the study, 5-year old sycamore reached an average height of 5.84 m [standard error (SE) = 0.39] and had an average diameter at breast height (dbh) of 5.91 cm (SE = 0.20), compared to 4-year old cottonwood height of 7.58 m (SE = 0.15) and dbh of 8.22 cm (SE = 0.34), respectively. Sycamore produced almost 30 Mg ha−1of total biomass, whereas cottonwood produced 53 Mg ha−1 by the end of the study. Total N and P uptake by sycamore was 327 (SE = 24) and 51 (SE = 4) kg ha−1 respectively, whereas cottonwood N and P uptake was 699 (SE = 41) and 99 (SE = 6) kg ha−1, respectively, by the end of the study. We conclude that SRWCs can use substantial amounts of nutrients from the decommissioned lagoons while producing wood and fiber products.@@@CAFOs

The study was conducted on four afforested post-mining sites after lignite, hard coal, sand and sulphur mining extraction. Site index (SI) was modeled as a function of the top height of a pine tree stand at a certain age and physico-chemical and biological properties of RMS. Field measurements were taken in tree stands ranging from 12 to 30 years of age. A total of 42 site trees (1–2 dominant trees on each plot) representing top height (H500) were cut and the age and height increment of each tree was estimated on the basis of distance between branch verticils. Soil samples were collected at 0–8, 8–50 and 50–110 cm depth and the following parameters were determined: soil texture, pH, total exchangeable bases TEB, cations exchangeable capacity, soil organic carbon (SOC), nutrient content (N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, P) and microbial properties (dehydrogenase activity; DHG). Statistical models were developed describing relationships between tree growth as expressed by SI and key mine soil properties. The best model explained a relatively large part (>60 %) of SI variability. In this model, the most influential RMS properties were: clay sized (<0.002 mm) fraction content, base saturation (BS%), available phosphorus (Pav) and biological activity (DHG). However, in acidic and sulphurised tertiary sands neutralized by bog lime, the correlation between SI and phosphorus was negative. This phenomenon can be explained in part by the possible disturbance of nutrient relationships in RMS. Developed models may be used to predict site potential productivity and pine tree growth on newly reclaimed areas, or to plan forest management strategies and transformation of existing pine monocultures to mixed hardwood forests developed on mining sites similar to those analysed in presented research.@@@Mine soils

We hypothesized that compaction could be related with the lack of natural regeneration and decline on cork oak stands. In this paper, we evaluated the response of cork oak seedlings growth in terms of area and biomass production for above and belowground parts at different compaction depths tested for a sandy-loam soil. This study was done in a greenhouse, with germinated seedlings. Three treatments were applied. One no-compaction treatment (control, C0) and two with a soil compacted layer at 60 cm (C1) and 30 cm depth (C2). The level of compacted layer was 1.37 MPa of mechanical resistance. Results show that tap root length is negatively affected by compaction at 60 and 30 cm depth. Below and aboveground biomass are affected by compaction at 30 cm depth. In addition, the leaf area results demonstrate that compaction is a sensitive factor for this parameter. In this 1-year stage, plants spend more energy in roots production. Due to soil formation and bad management of cork oak stands, soil compaction at depth could be a cause for the observed lack of natural regeneration, affecting the growth at earlier stages and probably for the decline of cork oak populations.@@@Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) seedlings

In this work our objective was to study the feasibility of storing Pinus radiata plant material at 4 °C for long periods in order to make easier the initiation with high amount of cell lines. The effect of cold storage on the different stages of somatic embryogenesis process has been evaluated. Storage periods of 1–3 months enhanced initiation rates and the number of somatic embryos obtained in the embryogenic cell lines. These results demonstrate the beneficial effect of cold storage and open the possibility of considering a cold preconditioning of plant material as a good alternative to improve the somatic embryogenesis process in conifers.@@@Conifer

The effects of soil nutrients and environmental factors on site productivity in chestnut coppice stands in North-West Spain were studied. Site productivity described by site index was related to environmental characteristics, including edaphic, physiographic and climatic variables. The key factors affecting site productivity were evaluated according to two different statistical analyses: the CHAID procedure and parametric regression techniques. The CHAID algorithm applied separately to each type of variable revealed that the most important to explain SI were edaphic (sand and clay percentage, pH, stoniness) and climatic variables (summer and spring precipitation and mean annual temperature) (24 and 47 %, respectively). According to the regression tree and the parametric regression model for all variables, summer precipitation was the most significant variable (51 and 53 %, respectively). The results show the importance of climatic variables for chestnut coppice stands growth and provide further information about the ecology of the species in North-West Spain. The use of specimens from sites representing a wide range of habitats/growing conditions of this species means that both the results and methodology described here are of great relevance for improving the management of this species throughout its European range.@@@Chestnut coppice

Successfully acclimatized microplants were transferred to a greenhouse and grown for 16 weeks in unpolluted soil irrigated during the cultivation period with solutions containing high concentrations of Cu or Pb ions or in soil contaminated with Cu and Pb collected 1 km from a copper smelter. Ectomycorrhizal inoculation enhanced the survival rate of plantlets during ex vitro acclimatization. Poplar microplants inoculated with H. crustuliniforme and selected strains of P. involutus accumulated higher concentrations of Cu and Pb when grown in contaminated soils than the uninoculated plants and reduced concentration of the metals in the soils. In conclusion, grey poplar microplants tolerant to heavy metals and inoculated with appropriate ectomycorrhizal fungi can facilitate the adaptation of these plants to metal-polluted soils and may be used for afforestation and phytoremediation of polluted land.@@@Copper

However, the effects of N-fertilization on production and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in managed forest ecosystems are poorly understood, unlike in agriculture where effects are well documented. Therefore, a review of the available literature was conducted to comprehend the effects of N-fertilization on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions in managed forest ecosystems to summarize sources, sinks, and controlling factors, as well as potential mitigation strategies and research gaps to reduce GHG emissions. This review clearly identifies the importance of N-fertilizer management practices on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. Potential N management practices to mitigate GHG emissions in managed forest ecosystems include improving N uptake efficiency, identifying and managing spatial variation in soil fertility, using the right fertilizer source at the right time, adopting appropriate methods of N-fertilizer application, and introducing nitrification/denitrification inhibitors. Nitrogen-fertilizer response is affected by soil physical (e.g., moisture, drainage, bulk density, and texture), chemical (e.g., nutrient availability, labile carbon, soil pH, and C/N ratio) and local climatic factors (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall). Therefore, the interactions of these factors on GHG emissions need to be considered while evaluating N-fertilizer management practices. Existing studies are often limited, focusing primarily on temperate forest ecosystems, lacking estimation of net emissions considering all three predominant soil-derived GHGs, and were often conducted on a small scale, making upscaling challenging. Therefore, large-scale studies conducted in diverse climates, evaluating cumulative net emissions, are needed to better understand N-fertilization effects on GHG emissions and develop mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies and research gaps have also been identified, which require the collaborative efforts of forest owners, managers, and scientists to increase adoption of N-fertilization best management practices and understand the importance of N-fertilizer management strategies in reducing emissions and enhancing the net GHG sink potential for managed forest ecosystems.@@@Carbon dioxide

In this study, 375 plots (0.01 ha) were installed across five stands in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. Trees ≥3.8 cm diameter at 1.37 m above groundline (dbh) were tagged, and dbh and species recorded. Stands were regenerated using a two-aged silvicultural system (residual basal area (BA) <6.3 m2 ha−1). One growing season post-harvest, we recorded (1) sprouting (yes/no), (2) the number of sprouts per stump (sprout density), and (3) dominant (tallest) sprout height. Sprout density, sprout height, and P(s) were modeled as function of dbh, site index (SI), and BA. For white (Quercus alba L.), black (Quercus velutina Lam.), scarlet (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.), and northern red (Quercus rubra L.) oaks, and sweet birch (Betula lenta L.), yellow buckeye (Aesculus flava Aiton), and red maple (Acer rubrum L.), P(s) was inversely related to dbh. Sprout density was positively related to (1) dbh for red maple, yellow buckeye, sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum L.

The National breeding program for the native species Prosopis alba is still in its initial phase with only a few progeny trials installed from material collected in the wild and the first genetic studies are underway. Breeding value (BV) estimates based on pedigree data from a progeny trial were first compared to those derived by using microsatellite based kinship estimates to confirm the potential accuracy of g-best linear unbiased predictions (G-BLUP) when pedigree information is lacking. Afterwards, the possible genetic effects of alternative selection strategies to collect improved seeds from a wild population were evaluated. To achieve this goal the relationship among average genetic gain (predicted by G-BLUP), inbreeding and sampling size of the collected materials were weighed in a wild population consisting of trees of similar ages. The results obtained suggest that kinship estimates based on molecular data and breeding value predictions BV used for the selection of elite trees in wild populations may contribute to improve the genetic properties of the founder population. Controlling kinship allows reducing sampling size from 20 to 10 individuals per origin with no significant increase of inbreeding or loss of genetic gain. For a selected group of only ten top individuals per origin, the replacement of two strongly reduces the average group coancestry with minimal gain loss. Simultaneous selection for two traits by selection index might produce a gain of near 6 % in height and 2 % in diameter. The use of molecular marker information may contribute to reduce the time needed in a P. alba improvement program.@@@BLUP

Silvicultural treatments included clearcutting using careful logging around advanced growth (CLAAG), uniform shelterwood (US), group shelterwood with (GS-s) or without scarification (GS), and an uncut control (control). After 10 years, height and ground-line diameter growth responses of advanced balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.) regeneration were substantial in CLAAG and GS compared to the control, and intermediate in US. Growth responses were proportional to increases in canopy light transmittance resulting from harvest. Advanced balsam fir regeneration had low mortality (<10 %) and a high potential for release as measured by the apical dominance ratio. At the stand level, however, a shift in species composition occurred in the regenerating cohort. Over the 10-year period, composition changed from conifer-dominated to hardwood-dominated in CLAAG, GS, and GS-s compared to the control. Scarification increased the magnitude of this shift by favoring shade-intolerant hardwoods. Results highlight the need to find a balance between releasing advance conifer regeneration and limiting competition from less desirable species.@@@Balsam fir

The data came from 40 permanent sample plots, representing site quality variability across the distribution area of E. nitens crops. Three inventories were carried out to collect tree data and determine stand variables. Additionally, edaphic, physiographic and climatic information were obtained and included in the model. For both functions, an ADA growth model was selected, which achieved high accuracy. The corresponding growth curves developed in this study had values of 5, 8, 11 and 14 m for dominant height and 4, 14, 24 and 34 m2 ha−1 for basal area at the base age of 4 years. The inclusion of environmental factors (i.e. soil and climatic variables) as parameters in the model resulted in good estimations and increased the model’s flexibility to adapt to small variations in site conditions. The model developed here is thus shown to be useful for simulating the growth of E. nitens crops when environmental information is available. A prediction function was fitted for use in stands without diameter inventories or not previously occupied by E. nitens, and including environmental variables improved its accuracy. Biomass mean annual increment varied from 3.25 to 18.45 Mg ha−1 year−1 at the end of the rotation, projected as between 6 and 12 years depending on site quality.@@@Eucalyptus

We examined the effects of pectinase [0, 0.5, 1, or 2 % (w/v)], benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0, 100, 200, 400, or 500 mg l−1) and dry storage (6, 9, or 12 months), on water uptake percentage (WUP) and seedling emergence rates with the endocarp intact or removed. Following treatments, seeds were subjected to a cold–warm–cold–warm–cold alternating temperature stratification regime, and then germinated at 23 °C for up to 90 days. The highest germination percentage (GP) of 37.7 and 32.7 % were obtained in seeds without endocarp treated at 500 mg l−1 BAP and dry-stored seeds for 12 months, respectively. WUP imbibed (96 h) in seeds with and without endocarp was 26.7 and 39.4 %, respectively, and the highest WUP was achieved in a period of 12 months (81 %). These results revealed that the application of BAP, pectinase, and dry storage significantly increased GP in C. pseudoheterophylla, probably mainly through dormancy-mediated processes.

Micropropagation followed by microcuttings propagation has the potential to rejuvenate the clones thereby enhancing the rooting potential and minimize intra clonal variation. In this study, 33 superior performing Eucalyptus camaldulensis clones were propagated by rooting of stem cuttings (SCs) and micropropagation. Micropropagated plantlets were used as stock plants for microcutting propagation. Rooting of SCs and micropropagation was carried out with the coppice shoot cuttings and axillary buds respectively, obtained from approximately fourteen year old trees that had undergone one vegetative propagation cycle. The adventitious rooting recorded was significantly higher in micropropagation (24.8–100 %) and microcuttings (43–95 %) than SCs method (9.3–75.5 %). Studies on ontogeny of adventitious rooting showed the emergence of root primordium from the phloem region and root initials were noticed within 5–9 days after auxin treatment. Further, molecular marker analysis showed genetic uniformity except for two ramets, detected using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers and suitable corrective measures were taken to avoid entry of such plantlets for mass multiplication. This study demonstrates the importance of integration of micropropagation and microcuttings production for rejuvenation and mass multiplication. Although current rejuvenation and root induction treatments favored adventitious rooting, the basic mechanisms involved in rejuvenation and adventitious rooting need to be explored for hassle free industrial rooting process, consequently cost effective propagation.@@@Adventitious rooting

We measured the rainfall interception and canopy storage capacity of individual trees of Pinus eldarica and Cupressus arizonica growing in an afforested Park located in an arid region of Iran. Correlations between percent relative interception and gross rainfall, mean daily wind speed, mean daily air temperature, and mean daily relative humidity were examined both for the wet and dry seasons. Canopy storage capacity was estimated by indirect methods: the Pereira, mean, minimum, and Gash and Morton. The cumulative mean values of percent relative interception and gross rainfall for P. eldarica and C. arizonica trees averaged 66 and 53 %, respectively. Combining meteorological parameters with rainfall depth only slightly improved the correlation with the percent of gross rainfall lost to interception loss in the dry season for P. eldarica (from 0.87 to 0.90) and C. arizonica (from 0.90 to 0.92). For P. eldarica, the mean estimate of canopy storage capacity was 1.31 versus 1.00 mm in C. arizonica trees. Because the storms in this region are small, the large canopy water storage of P. eldarica will result in greater interception losses relative to C. arizonica. Therefore, afforestation efforts would be better served planting C. arizonica over P. eldarica, if maximizing water inputs is a main management goal.@@@Afforestation

More severe preparation is thought to be necessary for intensive plantation silviculture, e.g., using fast-growing, ameliorated stocks, especially in boreal ecosystems. Although not justified scientifically, deep-planting of seedlings is often discouraged and may even be financially penalized in eastern Canada. We thus evaluated early seedling growth and survival of hybrid larch (Larix × marschlinsii Coaz) in an experiment including mechanical site preparation and planting depth treatments. Our results suggest that satisfactory early hybrid larch establishment and growth could be met using low environmental impact or low cost treatments (such as soil inversion using an excavator or single-pass disk trenching), and that deeper planting has no negative effect. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to explore causal relationships between factors influencing seedling performance at the local scale (planting microsites), including soil moisture, soil temperature, surrounding vegetation, and seedling nutrition. SEM analysis supported the absence of overall differences among treatments, while also highlighting the negative impact of increased soil water content where drainage was suboptimal, as well as the unexpected positive impact of increased competition on growth mostly through seedling nutrition, among others. These early observations will need to be confirmed over a longer period, as well as with a more comprehensive assessment of site environmental conditions and competition intensity.@@@Structural equation modelling (SEM)

All trees were measured to estimate individual heritabilities and genetic correlations for growth traits, stem straightness and pilodyn in the three trials, and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MoEd) of standing trees was only assessed in Tuyen Quang. There were significant differences between families for growth traits, stem straightness, pilodyn penetration and predicted MoEd. Heritabilities of growth traits, stem straightness, pilodyn and dynamic modulus of elasticity were low to moderate (h2 = 0.11–0.30). The coefficient of additive genetic variation for DBH, pilodyn and MoEd were moderate at age 3 or 4 years (CVa = 4.9–9.4 %). Genetic correlations between stem straightness, pilodyn and growth traits were favourable but weak, while those between growth traits and dynamic modulus of elasticity were weak and unfavourable. The substantial coefficients of additive genetic variation and significant heritabilities for all traits indicate that it should be possible to use a selection strategy that combines improvements in growth, stem straightness, and wood quality for A. mangium in Vietnam. The site–site genetic correlations between the two northern trials and Bau Bang site were low for growth traits, indicating that G × E effects are of practical importance for growth and different deployment populations will be required for different sites.@@@Acacia mangium

While cutting length and diameter, genetics and environmental conditions are often cited as major factors contributing to the successful establishment of cottonwood plantations, it is difficult to determine which specific cutting characteristic or mechanism leads to improved root establishment or plant development. For example, increasing stem size can affect rooting and subsequent plant growth by altering the cutting energy reserves as well as the surface area from which latent roots develop. In this study, the contribution of cutting length and belowground surface area to rooting and early growth was examined for eastern cottonwood. To discern cutting length effects, the belowground portion of four different cutting lengths was restricted so each cutting had the same belowground surface area available for rooting. To discern surface area effects, 40-cm-long cuttings were restricted to produce four different levels of surface area from which roots could develop. Leaf area, stem height, aboveground and belowground biomass, and root numbers were measured after 13 weeks of growth. The only statistically significant relationships related to biomass were due to the initial differences in cutting length. Cuttings with greater surface areas formed more lateral roots, while longer cuttings did not. By contrast, increased cutting lengths resulted in greater numbers of basal roots, but not for cuttings with greater belowground surface areas.@@@Root formation

In small-scale restoration projects revegetation is a common technique, but its success depends on the plant species used and some environmental filters. We investigated whether grass competition and soil compaction together with seasonal drought and flooding limit the establishment of seven tree species experimentally planted in abandoned riparian pastures in Southern Mexico. We tested the effects of grass clearing and soil tilling and analyzed seasonal variation of vertical distance to water level, and changes in tree performance, microclimate, and vegetation biomass after planting. Seedling survival was low (19 ± 3 %), ranging between 3 (Brosimum alicastrum, Moraceae) and 38 % (Pachira aquatica, Bombacaceae). Survival was negatively correlated to vertical distance to water level, highlighting the importance of the short but severe dry season that may occur in the humid tropics, which reduced survival by >60 %. Flooding events also produced high seedling mortality (80 % after the two first events). Clearing but not tilling enhanced seedling survival. Clearing also significantly increased seedling growth of some species, suggesting competition release. Tilling did not have any consistent effect on growth, but it appears to counteract the positive effects of clearing. Both pre-existing and planted trees ameliorated microclimate to produce better conditions for establishment of new trees following natural regeneration. We conclude that clearing can enhance seedling establishment in riparian abandoned tropical pastures, but other revegetation treatments intended to reduce soil drying and uprooting by flooding during early establishment should be evaluated to improve the cost-benefit of restoring riparian forest.@@@Growth

Predicting the response of rodent seed consumers to this novel source of mast will be critical to restoration success, as rodents are important seed predators and dispersers in forests that once included chestnut. In particular, frequency-dependent foraging responses by rodents could affect the rate of spread of rare chestnuts following reintroductions. We conducted field trials to test for seed preferences and frequency-dependent selection by fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) when combinations of American chestnut and two common associates [northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Q. alba)] were available in varying frequencies. Fox squirrels tended toward positive frequency-dependent seed predation when combinations of white oak and chestnuts were available, consuming more common mast items at a higher rate than expected based on availability. No preferences were observed between American chestnut and either red or white oak independent of frequency, but red oak was preferred over white oak. Frequency-dependent consumption of more common white oak acorns could benefit rarer chestnut during restoration, as squirrels would feed disproportionately on established white oak; however, this management strategy should only be considered following larger-scale and longer-term studies that consider impacts on white oak regeneration. Lack of preference or frequency dependence for chestnut when paired with red oak suggests that negative impacts of fox squirrel consumption on restoration will vary with the relative availability of the two seed types.@@@Castanea dentata

The CLAE at 80 or 120 g pot−1 significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate (P n), transpiration rate (T r) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C i), followed by a reduction of relative height growth and basal diameter growth. Under light saturation, apparent quantum yield, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P n max) in all treated groups and light respiration (R d) in A1 and A2 showed a decreasing trend, whereas light compensation point and light saturation point had an increased tendency. Under CO2 concentration saturation, carboxylation rate, P n max and light respiration (R p) first increased (A1) and dramatically decreased (A2 and A3) thereafter, whereas CO2 compensation point and CO2 saturation point increased. However, all parameters of the chlorophyll content of E. grandis seedlings were found to decrease with increased concentrations of CLAE. The results demonstrate that the aqueous extracts from C. septentrionale leaf litter have allelopathic potential and that a higher concentration of CLAE presents a risk or disadvantage to the growth of E. grandis seedling which suggests that the growth of E. grandis seedlings could be inhibited when planted under or near mature C. septentrionale plantation, and it is better not to develop mixed-plantation of C. septentrionale and E. grandis.@@@Cinnamomum septentrionale

To facilitate more consistent production of aspen seedlings with these characteristics requires the identification of the environmental conditions most responsible for directing resources to growth or to reserve storage. During nursery production, aspen seedlings are often sheltered from environmental stressors in greenhouses and exposed to variation in light quality and quantity, compared to outside conditions; the common result is that greenhouse grown seedlings exhibit greater allocation to shoot growth rather than to root structures and reserves. It is currently unclear whether this imbalance in R:S is the result of stronger environmental controls within a greenhouse on factors such as relative humidity, wind and temperature or rather on differences in the quantity and quality of light. In this study, we sought to determine what influence differences in both light quality and quantity, along with sheltering, has on the development of desired characteristics in aspen seedlings. To do so, we grew aspen seedlings in the field under one of six light treatments [unsheltered, full-sun (100 % full-sun); sheltered, full-sun (~90 %): sheltered, shaded (~40 %): sheltered, shaded blue (~40 %); sheltered, shaded red (~40 %); and sheltered, shaded low red/far-red ratio (~40 %)] to identify the combination of sheltering, light quality and quantity with the greatest influence on R:S and root NSC. The largest increase in desired characteristics was a peak in R:S and in root NSC for seedlings grown under unsheltered, full-sun conditions. These results suggest that growing seedlings outside, with pre-exposure to more stressful conditions prior to bud hardening, is the driver for the desired characteristics in species with indeterminate growth strategies such as aspen seedling stock.@@@Light spectrum

Taking their optimal silvicultural performance into account, selected genotypes will certainly represent an excellent alternative for future plantations. The cloning of superior genotypes is accomplished by vegetative propagation of mature trees, and requires physiologically juvenile or rejuvenated material. Special techniques are necessary to reverse the juvenility and adult tree recovery and promote favorable growth and rooting conditions. In the specific case of Eucalyptus sp., the most common vegetative rescue method used by forestry companies to obtain shoots (i.e., propagules) is the coppicing of adult trees, a technique which provides excellent juvenile shoots, favoring the adventitious rooting in cuttings. Cloning techniques are required to vegetative rescue and germoplasm banks formation of selected trees. The present study aimed to evaluate the vegetative rescue after the selection of phenotypes with superior silvicultural characteristics to clone adult trees of E. benthamii, evaluating which technique presented the best cloning result. The cuttings from canopy branches, epicormic shoots from the first (lowest) canopy branches, shoots obtained from girdling and shoots from the pruning of canopy branches were submitted to micropropagation, cutting, and microcutting techniques for each shoot type. Among the key findings for vegetative rescue and cloning, the percentage of in vitro establishment of epicormic shoot (79.2 %), ex vitro rooting (75.0 %) and acclimatization (27.8 %) were suitable. The cuttings of sprouts from girdling stood out as having rooting (18.7 % from greenhouse and 14.3 % from mini-incubator) and acclimation (11.2 % from greenhouse and 9.0 % from mini-incubator). The others vegetative propagations techniques tested did not result in shoot survival, rooting or acclimation.@@@Vegetative propagation

To gain a clearer understanding of the response to global change of growth and survival during regeneration it is necessary to take a closer look at the ecophysiological traits underlying seedling performance. Gas exchange, leaf water potential, chlorophyll fluorescence, soil moisture, temperature and global site factor were measured over 1 year in naturally regenerated young trees of three coexisting species (Pinus pinea, Quercus ilex and Juniperus oxycedrus) in two stands of different density. We modelled the photosynthetic response of plants to micro-climatic conditions via the parameterization of the non-rectangular hyperbolic model of photosynthesis, which relates gross photosynthesis to incident light through three biochemical parameters, and the subsequent expansion of these parameters as a function of environmental variables (light environment, soil moisture and temperature). We investigated the relationship between different photosynthetic performance and the species-specific strategies to cope with stress (stress tolerant or avoiders). The optimal light environment, defined through the global site factor (GSF), and the regeneration niche to maximize carbon assimilation differed between the three species. P. pinea showed high sensitivity to water availability in agreement with a drought avoidance strategy, attaining the maximum photosynthetic capacity of the three species following the spring rainfall. Q. ilex was the most thermophilic and light-demanding of the species. Under high light conditions, J. oxycedrus was more drought tolerant and displayed higher net CO2 assimilation than P. pinea over the course of a growing period. Optimal locations for P. pinea regeneration are below-crown environments, while for J. oxycedrus regeneration the optimal locations are open gaps. Q. ilex regeneration occupy open gaps where the other two species are unable to establish themselves because of excessive light, temperature or very low water availability. Competition between species will occur under a canopy gap fraction of 0.5. Higher GSF values will exclusively favour the regeneration of Q. ilex.@@@Regeneration niches

"824","Restoring forests: What constitutes success in the twenty-first century?@@@@@@Published: 05 October 2015 Issue Date: November 2015@@@Forest loss and degradation is occurring at high rates but humankind is experiencing historical momentum that favors forest restoration. Approaches to restoration may follow various paradigms depending on stakeholder objectives, regional climate, or the degree of site degradation. The vast amount of land requiring restoration implies the need for spatial prioritization of restoration efforts according to cost-benefit analyses that include ecological risks. To design resistant and resilient ecosystems that can adapt to emerging circumstances, an adaptive management approach is needed. Global change, in particular, imparts a high degree of uncertainty about the future ecological and societal conditions of forest ecosystems to be restored, as well as their desired goods and services. We must also reconsider the suite of species incorporated into restoration with the aim of moving toward more stress resistant and competitive combinations in the longer term. Non-native species may serve an important role under some circumstances, e.g., to facilitate reintroduction of native species. Propagation and field establishment techniques must promote survival through seedling stress resistance and site preparation. An improved ability to generalize among plant functional groups in ecological niche adaptations will help to overcome site-limiting factors. The magnitude and velocity of ongoing global change necessitates rapid responses in genetics that cannot be naturally induced at valid temporal and spatial scales. The capacity for new concepts and technologies to be adopted by managers and accepted by society will depend on effective technology transfer and a community-based approach to forest restoration. The many benefits human society gains from forests requires that forest restoration considers multiple objectives and approaches to minimize trade-offs in achieving these objectives.@@@Adaptive management

The islands may also become a laboratory for exploring new approaches to forest restoration because of a common history of degradation and the growing number of restoration projects undertaken. Approximately half of the native ecosystems of Hawai‘i have been converted to non-native conditions. Many restoration projects have focused on intensively managed out plantings of native plants with emphasis on threatened and endangered species. While these projects have been effective in stabilizing plant populations, this model is often prohibitively expensive for restoration at the scale needed to protect watersheds and provide habitat for rare bird species. Here we suggest ways of rethinking ecological restoration that are applicable across the tropics, particularly on islands and fire-prone grasslands. First, we suggest making use of non-native, non-invasive species to help reclaim degraded or invaded sites or as long-term components of planned restoration outcomes. Second, we suggest incorporating remote sensing techniques to refine where restoration is carried out. Finally, we suggest borrowing technologies in plant production, weed control, and site preparation from industrial forestry to lower restoration costs. These suggestions would result in ecosystems that differ from native reference systems in some cases but which could be applied to much larger areas than most current restoration efforts while providing important ecosystem services. We also stress that community involvement is key to successful restoration, as a major goal of almost all restoration projects is to re-connect the community with the forest.@@@Restoration ecology

Herein we provide an overview of the challenges inherent in efforts to restore mined landscapes to functioning forest ecosystems and present a synthesis of recent progress using examples from North America, Europe and Australia. We end with recommendations for further elaboration of the Forestry Reclamation Approach emphasizing: (1) Landform reconstruction modelled on natural systems and creation of topographic heterogeneity at a variety of scales; (2) Use and placement of overburden, capping materials and organic amendments to facilitate soil development processes and create a suitable rooting medium for trees; (3) Alignment of landform, topography, overburden, soil and tree species to create a diversity of target ecosystem types; (4) Combining optimization of stock type and planting techniques with early planting of a diversity of tree species; (5) Encouraging natural regeneration as much as possible; (6) Utilizing direct placement of forest floor material combined with seeding of native species to rapidly re-establish native forest understory vegetation; (7) Selective on-going management to encourage development along the desired successional trajectory. Successful restoration of forest ecosystems after severe mining disturbance will be facilitated by a regulatory framework that acknowledges and accepts variation in objectives and outcomes.@@@Mining

In this study, we evaluated the effects of nursery cultivation in large, novel containers and duration of cultivation on early field establishment of 2-year-old seedlings of Quercus robur L. and Juglans regia L. Two sizes (9800 and 15,500 cm3) of a new container (Superoots Air-pot®) and one size (4900 cm3) of a traditional container (Plastecnic®) were tested and seedlings were sampled for shoot and root growth and biomass allocation. Prolonging the cultivation period to 2 years had a positive effect on both species, with a marked increase in above- and below-ground biomass, maintaining a desirable balance between shoot and root systems. Both sizes of Air-pots for Q. robur and the bigger Air-pot for J. regia produced seedlings that were taller than 1.5 m, with a low branch component combined with a high frequency of apical dominance. The quantity and size of first order lateral roots varied between years within containers, and increased in deeper substrate layers during the second year. Early field results did not show marked signs of transplanting stress, but with low height growth in all treatments. Seedlings grown in both Air-pots exhibited well-developed and well-structured root and shoot systems, thus showing promise in the establishment of high quality timber plantations of fine hardwoods; such attributes can be beneficial wherever proper seedling shoot and/or root sizes confer an advantage in reforestation and restoration scenarios.@@@Persian walnut

These pressures, collectively, demand land managers to reassess current and potential forest management practices. We discuss three considerations, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, which are currently being debated in the literature and have the potential to be applied independently or concurrently across a variety of scales. The emphasis of functional restoration is to reestablish or maintain functions provided by the forest ecosystem, such as water quality, wildlife habitat, or carbon sequestration. Maintaining function may call upon actions such as assisted migration—moving tree populations within a species current range to aid adaptation to climate change or moving a species far outside its current range to avoid extinction—and we attempt to synthesize an array of assisted migration terminology. In addition, maintenance of species and the functions they provide may also require new technologies, such as genetic engineering, which, compared with traditional approaches to breeding for pest resistance, may be accomplished more rapidly to meet and overcome the challenges of invasive insect and disease pests. As managers develop holistic adaptive strategies to current and future anthropogenic stresses, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, either separately or in combinations, deserve consideration, but must be addressed within the context of the restoration goal.@@@Functional restoration

Restoration ecology, the scientific discipline that informs ecological restoration, must therefore evolve and expand its focus to address this need. To describe and evaluate the evolution of research pertaining to the ecological restoration of forests within the field of forestry, we performed a review of all 29,766 abstracts published over the last 35 years (1980–2014) in 15 leading forestry journals using automated content analysis, a machine learning-based tool for automated review of large volumes of literature (“big literature”). We found not only a 50-fold increase in the prominence of restoration ecology in forestry literature from 2000 to 2013, but also an evolution in the focus of forest restoration research. This evolution is likely in response to emerging topics and issues affecting forest restoration, such as exotic species, altered disturbance regimes, degraded tropical forests, and ecosystem services. Our results also revealed a pattern of “cyclic development,” in which research in the 1990s was focused on constructing theoretical frameworks, in the 2000s research appeared to be concentrated on restoration practices and programs, while in the 2010s research revisited established theoretical frameworks, possibly indicating a conceptual expansion. Our study highlighted gaps in research on important topics and emerging challenges, such as global climate change, genetic considerations, landscape-level factors, and restoring degraded systems, thus pointing the way for new and necessary research directions.@@@Automated content analysis (ACA)

Post-mining reforestation efforts have reached reliable tree survivability and growth; however, it is unclear whether these reforestation efforts also restore the ecological functions associated with the native forest ecosystem. The objectives of this study were to quantify the rate at which certain key ecosystem functions return to the landscape, and to relate the development of those functions to structural attributes of the ecosystem. A chronosequence of four reclaimed and reforested stands (ages 5, 11, 21 and 30 years) and unmined reference stands representing pre-mining conditions, were identified on the Appalachian Plateau in southwestern Virginia. Total soil nitrogen (N) and component (mineral soil, forest floor, root, and aboveground biomass) ecosystem carbon (C) pools were quantified. Throughout the growing season, monthly samples for soil gas fluxes [i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)], available inorganic-N [nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+)], and total and active microbial biomass were measured. As expected, soil organic C (SOC) and total ecosystem C returned to the mined landscape, although at levels still less than half of the unmined reference after 30 years. Ecosystem C accumulation was significantly correlated with soil N (r = 0.80; p = 0.0003) as well as total and active microbial biomass (r = 0.92; p = <0.0001 and r = 0.86; p = <0.0001, respectively). Surprisingly, available inorganic-N and gas fluxes of CO2 and N2O showed no significant differences among any of the mined and unmined stands; however, the reforested mined soils showed a significantly diminished capacity for CH4 uptake, where upland soils typically represent the largest global biogenic sink of atmospheric CH4. Thus, although many ecosystem components (e.g., forest and microbial biomass) and functions (e.g., N cycling), rapidly returned to the reclaimed landscape, some critical ecosystem functions (e.g., methanotrophy) exhibited a fundamentally different rate of return, if present at all. Our results indicate that reforestation of native hardwoods on reclaimed surface mined lands is largely successful at restoring many ecosystem functions, but that certain functional attributes are decoupled from the observed redevelopment of ecosystem structure. Thus, reforestation and forest ecosystem restoration are not necessarily the same thing, and a better understanding of potential disconnects between the two concepts can be critical in guiding both the science and the practice into the future.@@@Reforestation

Heightened international perception of the importance of forests and trees outside forests (e.g., woodlands, on farms) demands new approaches to future landscapes. The current need for forest restoration is two billion ha; most opportunities are mosaic restoration in the Tropical and Temperate Zones where human pressure is moderate. A rapidly changing global environment introduces uncertainty, however, that questions the usefulness of success criteria based on present or past ecosystems conditions. Considerable uncertainty arises from future climate and the timing of significant departures from current conditions, social system responses to drivers of global change, and ecosystem responses to changes in coupled socio-ecological systems. Three active approaches to reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptive capacity (incremental, anticipatory, transformational adaptation) differ in their future orientation but share similar objectives of favoring genotypes adapted to future conditions; resisting pathogens; managing herbivory to ensure adequate regeneration; encouraging species and structural diversity at the stand-level, landscape-level, or both; and providing connectivity and reducing fragmentation. Integrating attempts to restore landscapes and mitigate and adapt to climate change may synergistically increase adaptive capacity. Behavioral, institutional, and/or social barriers to implementing change can stop or delay adaptation. Stratagems for overcoming these barriers include conducting “risky” research that pushes the bounds of knowledge and practice and developing plant materials adapted to future conditions.@@@Functional restoration

We reviewed the role of stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and nitrogen (N) in juvenile woody species for spring growth and cold and drought stress tolerance, which are crucial processes for early performance of forest plantations. Plant functional types differed in NSC and N partitioning and allocation to new growth. In general, however, new leaves/shoots were more enriched in remobilized resources than new fine roots. Conifers used less remobilized resources than broadleaf species for fine root growth. New shoots/leaves were mostly comprised of remobilized N (>60 %) in conifers and broadleaf deciduous species, while broadleaf evergreens relied more on soil N (<50 % remobilized N). In contrast, few differences among functional groups existed in the contribution of remobilized carbon (C) to new leaves/shoots, which comprised 28–45 % of stored C reflecting the importance of current photosynthesis and distinctions in C and N remobilization physiology. The amount of N remobilized by an organ was positively related to its contribution to seedling N content. However, leaves are priority N sources in evergreens, which remobilized more N than predicted by their contribution to seedling N content. In contrast, roots in broadleaf evergreens and conifers were poor contributors of remobilized N. Under low stress, spring growth has little effect on NSC reserves. However, prolonged and intense photosynthesis depression strongly reduces NSC. In contrast, N reserves usually decline after planting and their replenishment takes longer than for NSC reserves. Strong storage reduction can hinder seedling stress acclimation and survival capacity. Resource storage can be promoted in the nursery by arresting plant growth and supplying resources at a higher rate than seedling growth and maintenance rate. We conclude that the way in which woody plants manage stored resources drives their growth and stress tolerance. However, plant functional types differ in storage physiology, which should be considered in silvicultural management.@@@Cultivation practices

Testing eco-techniques that mimic beneficial effects of natural structures and ameliorate stress contributes to positive solutions to overcoming establishment barriers. We ran a factorial experiment in a dry area, testing two levels of solid wall transmission of tube shelters (60 and 80 %) plus a control mesh, and two depths (shallow and 15 cm depth) of placing either planted seedlings or acorns of Quercus ilex. Microclimate of the planting or sowing spots was characterized by measuring photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and relative humidity. Plant response was evaluated in terms of survival, phenology, acorn emergence and photochemical efficiency (measured through chlorophyll fluorescence). We hypothesize that tube shelters and deep planting improve Q. ilex post-planting and sowing performance because of the combined effects of reducing excessive radiation and improving access to moist soil horizons. Results show that temperature and PAR was reduced, and relative humidity increased, in deep spots. Midsummer photochemical efficiency indicates highest level of stress for oaks in 80 % light transmission shelter. Optimum acorn emergence in spring was registered within solid wall tree shelters, and maximum summer survival of germinants and of planted seedlings occurred when acorns or seedlings were placed at 15 cm depth irrespectively of light transmission of shelter. Survival of germinants was similar to that of planted seedlings. The importance of techniques to keep high levels of viability after sowing recalcitrant seeds in the field is emphasized in the study.@@@Holm oak

Since then, entire stands of highly susceptible green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) have been killed within a few years of infestation. We have identified a small number of mature green ash trees which have been attacked by EAB, yet survived the peak EAB infestation that resulted in mortality of the rest of the ash cohort. Adult landing and feeding preference bioassays, leaf volatile quantification and EAB egg bioassay experiments were used to characterize potential differences in responses of these select “lingering” green ash trees relative to known EAB susceptible controls. Three selections were identified as being significantly less preferred for adult feeding, but no specific leaf volatile profile was associated with this reduced preference. Egg bioassays identified two ash selections that had significant differences in larval survival and development; one having a higher number of larvae killed by apparent host tree defenses and the other having lower larval weight. Correlation and validation of the bioassay results in replicated plantings to assess EAB resistance in the field is still necessary. However, the differences between lingering ash selections and susceptible controls measured by these bioassays indicate that more than one mechanism is responsible for the increased resistance to EAB that resulted in these selections surviving longer than their counterparts. Efforts to further increase ash resistance to EAB through use of these selections in a breeding program are underway.@@@Insect resistance

Although mineral nutrition is a critical aspect of seedling quality, fertility targets of Mediterranean sclerophylous species have not been thoroughly quantified. We sought to define those fertility targets for seedlings of Quercus ilex, a key species in Mediterranean areas. Nine fertility treatments, ranging from 0 to 200 mg N seedling−1 applied under an exponential regime were tested in a greenhouse dose response trial in which phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were increased in the same proportion as N (15N:5P:15K). Height and diameter growth were measured weekly, and biomass and nutritional status were analyzed at the end of culture (24 week). Plant growth and nutritional response to increased fertilization followed a curvilinear pattern depicting phases that ranged from deficiency to luxury consumption. Seedling dry mass production was maximized at 125 mg N seedling−1 (sufficiency level). N content and concentration increased with fertilization, reaching a maximum at 200 mg N seedling−1 (luxury consumption). P and K concentrations peaked at 75 and 25 mg N, respectively, suggesting a dilution effect of these nutrients. Root volume increased linearly up to 100 mg N and declined thereafter. The sufficiency level for Q. ilex (125 mg of applied N seedling−1) is notably higher than for other Quercus species from other biomes but intermediate to other Mediterranean Quercus species. No toxicity was observed at the highest treatment rate (200 mg N) suggesting that increased exponential N rates along with greater P and K proportions than those used in our experiment may further maximize nutrient storage.@@@Quercus ilex

A key example of this lies in Hawai‘i, where restoring native koa (Acacia koa, A. Gray) forests are a top conservation and forestry priority because of the critical habitat and high-value timber products that they provide. Efforts to restore koa forests, however, are directly impeded by extensive, non-native kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov.) swards occupying deforested montane landscapes. In this study, we implemented a combination of grass suppression and selection of koa seedling stocktypes to measure outplanting performance in a naturalized site on the island of Maui. Seedlings were grown in a nursery in two root container sizes (111 and 207 cm3) and subsequently outplanted into grass-dominated plots that were either untreated or suppressed with a high-rate herbicide combination of imazapyr and glyphosate (1.7 kg a.i. ha−1, respectively), 30 days prior to planting. Across all treatments, seedling survival was high (>95 %). Thirty months after planting, trees from the larger stocktype had significantly greater growth in height and root-collar diameter. Initial grass suppression resulted in trees that were 34 % taller with 66 % larger root-collar diameters after 30 months. Herbicide treated plots also had significantly higher leaf area indices (2.6 vs. 1.8 m2 m−2), indicative of higher photosynthetic capacity and canopy closure. Grass suppression increased soil temperature along with soil moisture in the first year followed by a dramatic drop in moisture corresponding to large growth responses by koa seedlings after the first year. These results demonstrate how the combination of fundamental silvicultural practices in the nursery and on the outplanting site can accelerate tree growth to meet restoration goals in shorter time intervals. This is a first report of koa (a leguminous species) tolerance to a high-rate, pre-plant application of the herbicide active ingredient imazapyr.@@@Hawai‘i

Here we address the potential for biochar use in the context of forest restoration, reviewing relevant experimental studies on biochar use in forest ecosystems, the properties of chars generated from wood waste material, and available data on tree growth responses to biochar. To our knowledge the earliest mention of char use as a soil amendment is actually specifically in the context of forest restoration (in the 1820s in Scotland). Wood waste biochars have an unusual set of properties that suggest their applicability in a forest restoration context: namely, high recalcitrance promoting long-lasting effects, retention of cations, anions, and water, in the soil, sorptive properties that can reduce bioavailability of a wide range of toxic materials, and relative ease of production from locally available feedstocks. A meta-analysis of recent studies on biochar responses of woody plants indicates a potential for large tree growth responses to biochar additions, with a mean 41 % increase in biomass. Responses are especially pronounced at early growth stages, and appear to be higher in boreal and tropical than in temperate systems, and in angiosperms than conifers; however, there is high variability, and field studies are few. The properties of biochars also vary greatly depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions; while this complicates their use, it provides a means to design biochars for specific restoration situations and objectives. We conclude that there is great promise for biochar to play an important role in a wide variety of forest restoration efforts, specifically as a replacement product for other forms of organic matter and liming agents.@@@Biochar

We assessed a 1-ha plot that was planted with 16 100-m2 islets of holm oak Quercus ilex subsp. ballota seedlings near Toledo (Spain) in 1993. In spring 2014 we measured (1) acorn predation and (2) seedling emergence from seeded acorns at different distances from and orientations around the islets with half of the acorns protected to prevent predation, (3) survival of emerged seedlings, and (4) natural tree establishment outside of the planted islets. Most (96.9 %) unprotected acorns were removed or predated. Seedling emergence from protected acorns ranged from 42.9 % on the northern side of the islets to 13.2 % on the southern side, suggesting a less stressful microclimate on the northern side. Survival of naturally established seedlings was 28.6 % by the end of first summer; seedling mortality was chiefly due to drought (45.0 %) and herbivory (35.0 %). Density of emerged seedlings, surviving seedlings after first dry season, and established oaks >1-year old was similar at different distances from the islets. Over the 21 year time period, 58 new oak individuals >1-year old have established (an average of 3.3 established individuals per ha per year) at an average distance of 6.3 ± 5.4 m away from the closest islet. We conclude that initial oak regeneration triggered by small planted islets in Mediterranean abandoned farmland is slowed down by high acorn predation, seedling herbivory, and stressful microclimatic conditions. Regardless, these islets are a viable tool for regeneration of Mediterranean oak woodland.@@@Acorn predation

Here we briefly review some of the definitions of resilience that have been proposed, including those referred to as “ecological” and “engineering” resilience. We also examine evidence for the existence of multiple stable states in forest ecosystems, on which concepts of ecological resilience are based. As evidence for multiple stable states is limited, we suggest that ecological resilience may often have limited value as a goal for forest restoration. We illustrate how engineering resilience can potentially be measured by estimating the rate of forest recovery following disturbance, through analysis of recovery trajectories using meta-analysis and ecological modelling approaches. We also highlight the potential value of resistance as a restoration goal, which can similarly be estimated using such approaches. Based on application of these concepts, we suggest how guidance for restoration practitioners could potentially be developed, to support the practical achievement of both resilience and resistance during forest restoration.@@@Ecological resilience

Most mycorrhizal fungi provide soil resources, particularly nitrogen (N), phosphorus and/or water to the tree, and can increase the abiotic and biotic stress resistance of their hosts. The fungi benefit by receiving fixed carbon from the tree. The association is of particular benefit on harsh or degraded sites. This review surveys recent literature on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations of temperate and boreal forest trees as it relates to N-nutrition and restoration of forests on sites where native mycorrhizal communities have been altered or depleted. Part I emphasizes the ECM fungal partners. Changes in ECM communities through primary and secondary succession are reviewed and related to the influence of N availability. The effect of N-related functional traits of ECM fungi on their distribution is discussed. Part II focuses on the ECM plant partners. The influence of ECM fungi on plant N uptake, and effects of N deposition and fertilization are presented. The benefit of ECM inoculation under different disturbance regimes and the benefit of greater ECM diversity are reviewed. Variations among and within tree and ECM fungal species in the forms of N taken up and utilized are highlighted. Conclusions include recommendations for including ECM fungi in forest restoration projects.@@@Ectomycorrhizae

Because of its shade intolerance and slow initial growth rate, shortleaf pine restoration has remained a challenge because competition from hardwoods exhibits greater initial growth following canopy removal but greater shade tolerance with canopy retention. The study objective was to examine the survival and growth of underplanted shortleaf pine seedlings relative to competing hardwoods as a function of initial seedling size, overstory density, and understory competition. In the Ozark Highlands of southeastern Missouri, USA, 48, 0.4-ha experimental units were each harvested from below to a uniform stocking level from 0 to 90 % and 30, 1–0 improved shortleaf pine seedlings were planted on a 3.7 × 7.3 m spacing. Linear or logistic regression was used to determine how shortleaf pine seedling (1) survival, (2) basal diameter growth, and (3) shoot growth were related to initial seedling size, overstory stocking, and understory competitor height during the first 5 years after underplanting. After five growing seasons, the survival rate of shortleaf pine seedlings was 50 % and was positively related to the initial basal diameter but was not related to overstory stocking or competitor height. Increasing overstory stocking decreased the basal diameter and height growth of shortleaf pine seedlings, explaining >51 % of the variation in basal diameter and 54 % of the variation in seedling height. Although competing hardwood seedlings were consistently taller than the shortleaf pine seedlings throughout the study, shortleaf pine seedlings maintained similar growth rates as competitors from the second to the fifth growing season. The eventual release of shortleaf pine is essential for recruitment, but releases can be delayed for several years after underplanting.@@@Hardwood competition

Establishing artificial shelters of dead branches (SODBs) could decrease acorn predation by protecting the seeds against domestic ungulates. However, rodents are also common in dehesas and their dual role as acorn predators and dispersers could be affected by the SODBs. Two experiments were conducted to assess this role of the SODBs on acorn survival and dispersal. They were carried out in six dehesa stands with different levels of rodent activity (i.e., high and low). The results revealed a positive effect of the SODBs on the acorns safety in those stands with low level of rodent activity. Here, the SODBs acted as effective physical barriers against livestock, and the acorn survival was significantly higher (3- to 7-fold) beneath the SODBs than in the Open treatment. Conversely, in those stands with high level of rodent activity the SODBs significantly increased acorn predation by rodents (acorn survival was 1.6- to 9-fold lower beneath the SODBs than in the Open treatment). In addition, the SODBs acted as preferred sink for dispersed acorns, but these acorns were completely predated by mice. These results suggest that establishing SODBs could be a suitable and inexpensive method to improve oak regeneration in dehesas and in other disturbed ecosystems, especially whether this method is combined with other simple techniques to protect acorns against predation by rodents.@@@Acorn predation

However, tools for evaluating the sensitivity of target sites and identifying potential sources have not yet been developed. We used the National Forest Inventories of Spain and France to design scenarios for AM between and within both countries. We characterized sensitivity to climate change as the expected changes in volume and mortality of Pinus halepensis Miller and Pinus pinaster Aiton between the present and 2050. Target zones were selected from provenances with high sensitivity and seed zones from provenances with low sensitivity to climate change; the latter can be considered “seed refugia” as the climate changes. Three plausible scenarios for translocation to the target zone were developed on the basis of volume simulations calibrated with different planting strategies: (1) seeds only from foreign provenances; (2) foreign provenances plus local seeds; and (3) only local seeds. The results for both species show that models based on foreign “top-three” provenances always increased the standing volume of the target zone. Models run with only local seeds predicted increased volume for P. halepensis but not for P. pinaster. Our results suggest that volume and mortality trends are not always correlated with seed sources and targets, that projected provenances mortality do not follow always a southern–northern pattern and that seed refugia, if any, may be useful for compensating for the effects of climate change only in a subset of provenances.@@@Translocation

Restoring these forests with these species is challenging since they are light demanding and the understory becomes dominated by bamboo (Chusquea culeou), which prevents natural regeneration. In this study we aimed to evaluate the root-collar diameter (RCD) and height growth response of these species during their seedling and sapling stages (years 1, 2, 3 and 6) after outplanting and removing the understory in a relatively low-light environment in a high-graded forest (incident light levels between 2.6 and 12.7 mol m−2 d−1). We fitted regression models to predict annual growth as a function of light availability, and used species as an indicator variable. RCD growth was significantly affected by light since the onset, and height growth only at ages 3 and 6. Species became a significant variable only at years 3 and 6 for RCD growth, and at age 6 for height growth. N. dombeyi grew faster than N. alpina throughout all the period, and both species had their greatest response to light the last years evaluated (adj. r 2 of 0.67 and 0.45 in RCD and height growth, respectively), i.e. an increasing intolerance to shade (ontogenetic change). The increasing variability of the data and the goodness-of-fit of the models at this stage suggest that light is becoming a major driver of growth. These results illustrate a good potential use of these species for restoration of Andean forests.@@@Restoration

The search for methods to reduce seed predation is therefore a key issue to broaden reforestation options and restoration success. In this study we tested (1) the effectiveness of a new device to prevent small mammals from consuming large seeds such as acorns and (2) its effect on initial seedling performance. The device consists of a capsule made of two truncated pyramids joined at the bases, with two small openings at the top and the bottom where the stem and root can exit but rodents cannot enter. We conducted a field seed-predation experiment using fenced plots (only rodents present) and unfenced plots (rodents + wild boar present) and a nursery experiment to check seedling emergence and growth. Acorn predation by rodents was almost nil when protected by the device (1.1 vs. 53.4 % without seed shelter), whereas predation by wild boar in the unfenced plots was not reduced by the device (12.4 %). In the nursery experiment there was no effect of the device on seedling emergence or growth. These results suggest that physical protectors like the one used in this study could represent a cheap method to foster the restoration of tree cover via seed sowing, especially if used in combination with fences or habitat features to reduce predation by large animals.@@@Seed predation

In our Liriodendron breeding programme, we conducted a very effective strategy on selecting elite parental combinations with strong heterosis on the basis of a large number of crosses and progeny tests. In the past two decades, we have conducted dozens of interspecies crosses in Liriodendron and the hybrids with good performance have been broadly planted for both ornamental and industrial utilization in southern China. In contrast to the application, the genetic mechanism of heterosis in Liriodendron still remains unknown. Genetic distance is one key parameter which has been considered for parent-pair selection. Here, we reported the relationship between parental genetic distance and offspring heterosis by analyzing early growth traits of progenies from intra- and inter-specific crosses in Liriodendron. The genetic distances among 13 parental trees were assessed based on polymorphisms generated from 24 microsatellites loci. Offspring heterosis was estimated based on a 6-year-old progeny test. No significant correlations were found between parental genetic distance and offspring heterosis. However, we found that the offspring heterosis of growth reached the maximum value when parental genetic distance was 1.07, which was validated in another batch of crosses based on 2-year-old growth. Our findings may be helpful for the future parent-pair selection in Liriodendron cross-breeding programmes.@@@Liriodendron

Moderate to high levels of genetic diversity were observed within all demes for the SSR and AFLP markers. The Shannon index for the AFLP markers was positively and significantly correlated with the average observed heterozygosity for the SSR markers across the demes. Comparative analysis of the numbers of the full-sibling groups inferred by different algorithms suggested that the 2-allele algorithm was more accurate than the other methods used in the study. However, in general, significant correlations were found in the numbers of the full-sibling groups inferred by some other algorithms, such as a heuristic algorithm, the 2-allele algorithm, and the Simpson, modified Simpson and pairwise score algorithms. Among demes, the USA and Swiss demes had the highest and lowest numbers, respectively, of full-sibling groups. This combined approach for sibship reconstruction can also be applied to infer the number of paternal or maternal parents in forest tree plantations when no parental information is available; this approach can improve our understanding of family structure and the extent of genetic diversity within forest tree plantations when no diversity, origin, or parental genotypes information is available.@@@Aspen demes

Genetically improved seed, sourced from selected genotypes and propagated in seed orchards, is a primary seed source for artificial regeneration. Volume improvements gained by planting selected genotypes of Picea glauca sources range from 9 to 30 %; however, tradeoffs associated with selection for volume are relatively unexplored for allometry and needle traits. Biomass allocation is of particular interest, especially if increased wood production comes at the expense of root allocation. Open-pollinated seedlings from wild and selected genotypes were planted. Sixty seedlings per source were destructively sampled per year after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 growing seasons. Roots, stems, and needles were separated, dried and weighed. Tree height and caliper at root collar were measured, along with specific leaf area. Selected genotypes were allometrically similar to wild sources. Tree heights and biomass allocation were similar between sources during years 2–4. By year 5, selected genotypes averaged 30 % more volume and root mass than wild sources but maintained similar allometric ratios. SLA declined with each year and did not differ between sources. Our results suggest that superior volume growth in selected stock is not the result of alterations in biomass allocation or needle morphology: increases in stem mass were associated with tandem increases in root mass.@@@Picea glauca

Pistacia lentiscus is of particular interest in restoration actions in fire-prone areas. This study addressed the current knowledge gap on the physiological response of this species to drought during its initial development. We hypothesized that the seedlings would have a high resistance to drought. In addition, we expected that seedlings from two sources with contrasting climate conditions would perform distinctly under drought. Seeds were collected from two populations in north and south Portugal. Seedlings were subjected to a progressively lower osmotic potential during 25 days, through increasing PEG concentration in the hydroponic solution. The physiological response of the seedlings was assessed by measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence after 15 and 25 days of drought exposure, when the osmotic potential was −2.47 and −5.17 MPa, respectively. Shoot growth, net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration were significantly reduced under drought conditions, whilst intrinsic water-use efficiency (IWUE) remained unaffected. This response partially agreed with the known strategy of P. lentiscus to cope with drought, typically maintaining high IWUE, however the observed reduction in stomatal conductance was not as pronounced as expected. Drought induced a decrease in leaf pigments that could be linked to photo-protective mechanisms. Seed source did not have a significant effect on drought response. P. lentiscus showed a high resistance to drought, which clearly supported its use in restoration actions in the Mediterranean, but these findings require further testing under field conditions.@@@Osmotic stress

The mechanisms for the release of seed dormancy have been less well studied. Using smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria var. Cinerea Engler) seeds, the effect of cold moist stratification (5 °C, 18.5 % humidity and 0–75 days) on dormancy release, changes of respiration rate, ABA and GA3 content, and the differentially expressed proteins during dormancy release were investigated. Seed dormancy was released during cold moist stratification, seed respiration rate was increased while both ABA and GA3 concentrations were decreased. A total of 28 protein spots with significant changes in relative expression abundance were detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among these protein spots, four proteins of ATPase β subunit, heat-shock cognate protein 70, aspartic proteinase 1 and actin were successfully identified by the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These four proteins were all down-expressed during dormancy release, and their possible implications for dormancy release of C. coggygria seeds was discussed.

In the eastern region of NW Patagonia, stands of the fast-growing exotic conifers Pinus ponderosa (Ponderosa pine) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir) are being established in places which are currently, or were in the past, occupied by native Austrocedrus chilensis (mountain cypress) forests. We hypothesize that mitigation techniques could (1) reduce photoinhibition and consequently increase the net photosynthesis rate of plants under high radiation conditions due to increases in the dissipation of radiation with Kaolin, (2) improve water availability in soils using hydrogel, and (3) reduce the effects of chills and frosts events in the species that are most susceptible to environmental stress, A. chilensis and P. menziesii, achieving similar values to those measured in the most resistant species, P. ponderosa using film-forming polymers such as Poly-1-p-Menthene. The short-term responses of seedlings to solar radiation, soil water availability and air temperature were evaluated through gas exchange capacities. Our results indicate that the effects of the different techniques depend on the susceptibility of the species to environmental stress. Kaolin treatment increased stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration rates in all species. For the hydrogel assay, higher pot volumetric water content was observed in treated plants than in control plants. Pinus ponderosa showed a lower response to the application of hydrogel, while a positive response was observed in A. chilensis and no effect in P. menziesii. The frost mitigation technique evaluated proved unsuitable for the three study species, but appears to work as an anti-desiccant for P. menziesii.

However, northern white-cedar forested wetlands are declining in area from forestry activities and development, with mitigation efforts often failing to reproduce these ecosystems. For this reason, the goal of this project was to determine the feasibility of creating a northern white-cedar forested wetland as a wetland mitigation option. Microtopography has been shown to be important for northern white-cedar establishment and recruitment, so a series of hummocks and flat areas were created and planted with northern white-cedar seedlings in two created wetlands in northern Michigan, USA. We examined the influence of microtopography and exposure to deer browse on white-cedar survivorship and height growth, 2 and 5 years after establishment. Hummock microtopography increased both tree survival and height growth. Percent survival after 5 years in protected fenced areas was 75 % on hummocks, while percent survival was only 15 % in protected fenced flat areas. Height growth rates were also greater on fenced hummocks, averaging 30 cm per year, compared to an average of 8 cm per year on fenced flat areas. Protection from browsing also improved white-cedar survival and height growth. Fenced white-cedar had 15–20 % greater survival compared to unfenced white-cedar and had 25–100 % greater growth rates. Our results indicate that incorporating microtopography and protection from browsing into future restoration or regeneration projects involving northern white-cedar should be considered as a viable option where high or variable water tables are expected.@@@Wetland creation

The greatest obstacle to afforestation, however, is the long delay before initial financial returns from wood harvesting are realized. Interplanting young trees with food or energy crops has been proposed as a strategy to help overcome this obstacle. We investigated the impact of this practice on the survival and growth performance of young tropical tree seedlings in Panama. Five native timber tree species and the exotic species Tectona grandis were interplanted with four different crop rotations and monitored over 2 years. Survival of young tree seedlings was up to eight times higher when planted in association with Manihot esculenta. Only during the first 3 months after maize sowing was a significant negative effect of intercropping on tree seedling survival found. Here, survival rate of tree seedlings was up to four times lower than in the pure plantation. Tree growth was not adversely affected by crops. In fact, Astronium graveolens, Cedrela odorata and Terminalia amazonia showed significantly superior growth performance in association with both Zea mays and Cajanus cajan. When combined with the latter, the height increment of these tree species was up to four times that achieved in pure plantations. We conclude that intercropping can be an important silvicultural practice to facilitate forest restoration. Multi-purpose shrubby crop species with cropping cycles of more than 6 months are particularly beneficial, as they quickly shade out grasses, thus reducing the need for herbicides.@@@Taungya

"855","Bareroot versus container stocktypes: a performance comparison@@@@@@Received: 18 August 2014 Accepted: 02 March 2015 Published: 10 March 2015 Issue Date: January 2016@@@This review examines the published work on bareroot and container stocktypes in forest restoration programs. The objective was to define overall trends between these two stocktypes and describe what they mean in terms of available information on their nursery and field performance. Stock quality assessments show bareroot seedlings have larger shoot systems because they are typically grown at lower densities, and in many instances longer timeframes, than container seedlings. Container systems typically produce seedlings having a lower shoot to root ratio and a greater root growth potential, conferring greater drought avoidance potential. However, assessments of stress resistance and nutrition found no conclusive evidence that either stocktype has a performance advantage, other than the container plug acting as a source of water and nutrient storage available for outplanting performance. Bareroot seedlings are more sensitive to handling practices of lifting, storage, transport and planting and these practices can negatively affect their performance. Container seedlings can have a higher level of field survival which is related, in part, to their greater drought avoidance potential, thereby overcoming planting stress. Bareroot and container seedlings have comparable survival rates on sites with minimal planting stress. Once seedlings are established, bareroot and container seedlings can have comparable field performance. In many instances where plant competition is the main limiting site variable, larger sized bareroot and container stocktypes have the best chance for successful stand establishment. The lack of a natural root form and root distribution for both stocktypes is a debated mechanical stability issue, though risks of windthrow have not been consistently demonstrated for either stocktype.@@@Bareroot seedlings

Hook] is one of the most important plantation tree species in subtropical China, accounting for about 21 % of China’s total forest plantation area. Although many studies have been conducted in Chinese fir plantations, uncertainties remain regarding its potential and dynamics to sequestrate carbon as a function of stand type, stand age and management. In this study, we applied tree ring analysis as a retrospective tool to study tree- and stand-level aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in a 17-year old Chinese fir plantation in Shitai County, Anhui Province, China. A total of 18 trees from different dominance classes were felled for the stem analyses: 6 dominant, 6 co-dominant and 6 suppressed trees. The stem analyses showed that as expected the annual increments of dbh and AGB were significantly higher for dominant trees than those for co-dominant and suppressed trees. Total stand-level AGB increased from 1.85 t ha−1 at age 3 years to 108.12 t ha−1 at age 17 years. Splitting the stand into dominance classes, tree analysis was useful to explain variation of the stand-level AGB and provided more detailed information about the growth dynamics of the stands. Tree ring analyses offer a viable and efficient approach to retrospectively study tree growth and AGB accumulation dynamics in Chinese fir plantations. In the studied stand under the given management regime, a rotation period of 17 years would optizimise AGB productivity.@@@Tree ring analysis

Results show that fertilizer doses significantly (p = 0.03) affect the number of cuttings that could be produced by stockplants 6 months after application. The mean number of cuttings per plant increased with fertilizer doses with the highest value of 11.06 ± 0.41 % for 50 g. Application of NPK 20-20-20 foliar fertilizer on stem cuttings at callus stage, significantly (p = 0.04) boosted rooting of stem cuttings after 28 weeks (85.71 ± 4.1 %). Number of roots per cutting was not significantly different (p = 0.98). However, the highest frequency of cuttings displayed three roots was observed on NPK 20-20-20 (To + Cal) and NPK 30-10-10 (To + Cal). From this study, we can conclude that, 50 g of NPK 20-10-10 fertilizer application on stockplants produced the greatest number of vegetal material. Treated with NPK 20-20-20 at callus initiation stage or both (i.e. at setting and at callus initiation stage), rooting performs better.@@@Domestication

Wood volume growth per unit evapotranspiration (plantation water productivity) was increased by irrigation for both species in the 3rd and 4th growing year but only in E. nitens in the 5th year. Irrigated trees required significantly less water than water-limited trees to produce 1 m3 of wood. At the same site, stomatal conductance was significantly greater in irrigated compared to water stressed trees through spring, summer and early autumn of each year. These data provide indirect evidence that leaf-scale measures of water-use efficiency are not well correlated with stand-scale measures of plantation water productivity. This was probably due to increased proportional allocation of assimilated carbon to stem wood in the irrigated compared to the water-limited stands. These results are consistent with recent studies in Brazil and Australia and suggest that plantation management systems, inclusive of tree breeding, that maximise growth rather than leaf-scale water-use efficiency, will also maximise the amount of wood produced from each unit of water used by the stand.@@@Water-use efficiency

This study was conducted to determine factors that influence tree species configurations and how tree characteristics affect canopy cover in cocoa farms. Eighty-six farmers and corresponding farms were selected in a systematic approach in four districts across two agro-ecological zones in Ghana. Results show that men tend to have larger farm sizes, higher tree density and diversity than women. Tree density and canopy cover of shade trees were low on large farms, but diversity increased with increasing farm sizes. Even though there was a significant correlation between diameter at breast height and crown area for all species investigated, tree species differed considerably in their crown area and thus the amount of ground cover provided. Current recommendations for shade are usually expressed in number of trees per ha, and our results suggest that these should be refined to reflect the effects of species, the size of their diameter at breast height and the crown area.@@@Cocoa agroforest

However, there are uncertainties about the genetic purity of hybrid larch seed lots due to mixture of pure and hybrid seeds in the outputs of commercial hybrid larch seed orchards. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of visible + near infrared (Vis + NIR) spectroscopy to distinguish European × Japanese larch (Larix × eurolepis) from pure European (Larix decidua) and Japanese (Larix kaempferi) larch seeds. Vis + NIR reflectance spectra were obtained using single seeds, and discriminant models were developed with partial-least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on both raw and pre-treated spectra. The best PLS-DA model assigned L. × eurolepis and L. decidua seeds to their respective classes with 100 % accuracy while that of L. kaempferi with 97 % accuracy. The best OPLS-DA model resulted in 100 % classification accuracy of pure and hybrid larch seeds. The origins of spectral differences between pure and hybrid larch seeds were attributed to differences in color, seed moisture content, fatty acids and proteins. In conclusion, the result demonstrates the feasibility of Vis + NIR spectroscopy as a powerful non-destructive method for verification of hybrid larch seeds, which is of great importance in maintaining the genetic purity of hybrid seed lots and for monitoring natural hybridization in commercial open pollinated mixed species seed orchard.@@@Hybridization

Backcross breeding programs that transfer blight disease resistance from Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) into American chestnut (C. dentata) offer promise for chestnut restoration, particularly for the American chestnut which was a keystone species in eastern North America. Nursery prescriptions and conformity to desired American chestnut traits following planting must be tested, however, before blight resistance can even be evaluated. We tested early field performance of American and Chinese chestnut and hybrid seedlings from the third backcross generation (e.g., BC3F3) in two-aged regeneration harvests on highly productive sites in the southern Appalachians, USA. We also tested a common nursery prescription of grading seedlings by size prior to planting. BC3F3 seedlings had similar 4-year survival to American chestnut seedlings, but generally had smaller stem heights and ground-line diameters (GLD). Although blight had not yet substantially challenged some sites, the BC3F3 seedlings had blight incidence similar to the Chinese chestnut which was lower than the American chestnut. Visual seedling grading affected planting shock and stem height and GLD by the end of year 4. Large size-class seedlings had more stem dieback and 5 % lower survival compared to small size-class seedlings, but larger trees exhibited the same height in year 3 as small trees in year 4. Advanced breeding material (BC3F3) was successfully established during the stand initiation phase of forest development on highly productive sites, but deviations in desired growth rate of the American chestnut was evident. Visual grading of seedlings affected establishment of breeding material, and should be considered in the restoration process.@@@Artificial regeneration

We evaluated the relationship between initial seedling root depth, temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture during drought after outplanting, and subsequent seedling performance using seedlings of Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. ponderosa grown in three containers similar in dimension except for depth (i.e. three stocktypes). Soil moisture patterns were quantified and growth, gas exchange, and carbon isotope analysis were used as metrics for stocktype evaluation. Soil moisture reached minimum volumetric soil moisture contents (θ) of 0.078 m3 m−3 at a 15 cm depth and 0.15 m3 m−3 at 90 cm by late summer, which also translated to estimated soil water potential (Ψ soil) values of −2.29 and −0.02 MPa, respectively. Seedling photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) rates followed soil moisture trends, also reaching seasonal lows in late summer. In early fall, gas exchange rates nearly doubled following a replenishment of upper-profile soil moisture by precipitation. Over the course of the growing season, stocktypes did not differ in gas exchange rates (P ≥ 0.15), biomass (P ≥ 0.45), root penetration depth (P = 0.60), or carbon isotope signature (P ≥ 0.60). For all seedlings, current-year needles showed greater capacity for A than previous-year needles (P ≤ 0.01), and A was only significantly correlated with soil moisture in the upper soil profile (15 cm; P ≤ 0.03). In this study, stocktype was not a significant factor, suggesting that seedling access to soil moisture was not different among them. The temporal and spatial variation observed in soil moisture availability, however, provides critical biophysical information on outplanting timing as it relates to subsequent seedling establishment and potential root growth. As well, needle formation, carbon gain, and the relationship to soil water depth further indicate the importance for managing soil water or seedling stocktype for successful seedling survival and growth.@@@Ponderosa pine

This has largely been achieved through long-term investments in tree breeding programs that select the best-performing genotypes for varied regional environments. However, climate change could threaten the realisation of genetic improvement in plantations due to suboptimal matching of improved planting stock to new climate conditions. Here, we investigate how information from genetic field tests could be utilised under anticipated climate change. We use principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance measures to find the closest match between climate of plantation regions in the future and current climate of field test sites. By 2050, future climates of some important plantation regions are expected to match climates currently present in different regions. For example, future climates of Green Triangle, a key plantation region in Australia, will better match current climate of Western Australia. The Central North Island of New Zealand will shift to warmer and wetter climate with no current analogue, and Western Australia, to warmer and drier no-analogue climate. The latter is also likely to fall outside the climate niche where radiata pine can be grown in the future. Nevertheless, for the majority of radiata pine plantation regions in Australia and New Zealand our analysis provides a framework of how anticipated climate change can be addressed in tree improvement programs using existing field tests.@@@Pinus radiata

The treatments included intact plants and juvenile plant coppice (cut at 13 months of age). Coppice was managed either with thinning to two sprouts/stump at 9 months after harvesting or without sprout thinning. The diameter of the intact plants was greater than that of coppice for clones 58, GG100, 26 and 8B, and no differences were noted between treatments for the other clones. Yield did not differ between the thinned and unthinned sprouts for most clones. At younger ages, the coppice yield was greater than that of the intact plants for most clones. Later, there was a decline in the coppice yield, and intact plants surpassed coppice. Then, the maximum coppice mean annual increment was achieved at younger ages than for the intact plants, which resulted in coppice rotation age shortening. The greatest differences between the coppice and intact plants yield was between 38 and 40 months, when the coppice yield was 59, 56, 127, 149 and 75 % greater than that of the intact plants, for the clones 58, GG100, 1000, 36 and 910, respectively. Clone GG100 revealed the highest yield estimation among the intact and coppice plants. The results indicate that by coppicing juvenile eucalypt clone plants, in dense stands, it is possible to produce biomass for energy, without sprout thinning, if rotation age is shortened.@@@Juvenile plant coppice

This study aims to evaluate the composition of seed banks in three successional stages of the lower montane peri-urban forest in Veracruz, Mexico, and experimentally determine the role of an exotic grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) in suppressing seed bank expression. For this, soil samples were collected from an abandoned pasture (P), a young secondary forest (SF), and an old secondary forest (F), and grass was experimentally removed in P. Seed density (seeds/m2) was higher in P (12,189 ± 2421), followed by SF (2825 ± 347) and F (3552 ± 865) with 76, 75 and 78 species, respectively. Tree seeds accounted for 1689 (P), 126 (SF) and 265 (F) emerged seedlings of 6, 8 and 6 tree species, respectively. The highest percentage of pioneer tree species was recorded in P seed banks (99 %). Similarity in tree species composition of the seed banks was higher between P and SF (Jaccard = 0.8) than between P and F (0.5). Similarity between soil seed bank tree species and tree standing vegetation was higher in P than in SF and F. Aboveground (1810 g/m2) and belowground (508 g/m2) biomass of C. plectostachyus is suppressing the emergence of individuals from the seed bank: when the grass was removed, nine woody species became established. Exotic grass removal in small nuclei may trigger early forest recovery through allowing the establishment of the tree species already present in the soil seed bank.@@@Cynodon plectostachyus

The species has high economic and recreational value but is vulnerable to extinction due to introduced pests and global warming. Somatic embryogenesis technology may assist in the clonal production of desired lines of Christmas trees and safekeeping of rare and valuable germplasm via cryopreservation. We have developed a highly effective medium for initiation of embryogenic tissue from immature or mature seeds of Fraser fir that contains AL salts (Kvaalen et al., in Can J For Res 35:1053–1060, 2005), brassinolide, paclobutrazol and abscisic acid. Using dominant embryos attached to the female gametophyte placed on medium, the highest initiation percentages occurred with precotyledonary stage 3 embryos. When tested with 11 high-value open-pollinated families over 5 years, initiation tests for medium containing brassinolide and paclobutrazol averaged 6–62 % initiation. A maintenance medium was developed that contained AL salts and 1.1 mg L−1 BAP and was able to capture approximately 50 % of the initiations. A maturation medium was developed containing AL salts, maltose, polyethylene glycol 8000 and abscisic acid that produced cotyledonary embryos capable of germination to produce a root and shoot.

Families of high (HG) and low (LG) growth rate were subject to moderate and severe water stress. Families only differed in growth under the high water availability condition (control treatment), declining exponentially to similar values in all families under drought. HG families presented higher absolute growth but lower relative growth than LG families. Hydraulic conductivity of branches decreased at high air saturation deficit (D) even with high soil water content due to high vulnerability to cavitation (mean P 50 = 1.7 MPa) and poor stomatal control of water potential in all families (which was even lower in LG). LG families presented higher carbon fixation capacity (per unit leaf area) but this could not be reflected in absolute growth due to their higher biomass allocation to roots compared to HG families. HG2 family allocated more biomass to leaves than the other families, increasing its whole capacity of C fixation. HG1 family had a differential allocation to the stem, probably increasing whole hydraulic conductance and capacitance, and therefore having an efficient way of providing water to the leaves. Our results does not support the hypothesis of a tradeoff between growth and drought resistance in Pinus taeda, but that there are different combinations of traits, as those of HG families, leading to high absolute growth when soil water availability is high, and low growth—but similar to that of LG families—under water deficit conditions.@@@Genetic variability

This study addresses the potential distribution of three Mediterranean pine species (Pinus pinea L., P. halepensis Mill. and P. pinaster Aiton) in southern Spain in response to the forecast increased aridity. Pines constitute a useful source of various types of raw materials, which has led to their increasing introduction around the world. The study was based on ecological niche modelling using multinomial logistic regression, over an area spanning about 8.7 million ha in the south of Spain. In total, 11 explanatory variables were included, drawing on measurements made at high resolution (200 m). Four different periods were studied: the reference period (1961–2000), early twenty-first century (2011–2040), middle twenty-first century (2041–2070) and late twenty-first century (2071–2100). Future time slices were analysed in three different scenarios: B1, A1b and A2 in the CNCM3 general circulation model. The results predict a wider distribution for stone pine, which could expand its potential area in southern Spain. In contrast, Aleppo pine, and especially cluster pine, would reduce their present distribution, with cluster pine occupying higher altitude sites while low altitude populations diminished. The validation model enables accurate maps to be produced, representing powerful tools for afforestation/reforestation programs in the future.@@@Ecological niche modelling

We examined outplanting performance of nutrient loaded and standard trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings, along with composition and cover of competing vegetation, on a boreal oil sands reclamation site with two different soil types (forest floor mineral mix and peat mineral mix) and four different broadcast fertilizer applications [250 kg/ha immediately available fertilizer (IAF), 500 kg/ha IAF, 670 kg/ha controlled release fertilizer, and an unfertilized control]. Average height growth across all treatments was 19 % greater for nutrient loaded aspen seedlings than standard seedlings after two growing seasons. With respect to soil types, aspen growth was greater on peat mineral mix and seedlings growing in this soil type showed a greater response to both nutrient loading and fertilization; however, this could partially be attributed to greater cover by competing vegetation on the forest floor mineral mix. In the first growing season, trees treated with immediately available fertilizer showed the greatest growth response but in the second growing season only the controlled release fertilizer application resulted in growth rates greater than the controls. Fertilizer regime had similar effects on total cover of competing vegetation, although fertilization additionally promoted increased cover of grasses in the forest floor mineral mix. Overall, we clearly show that nutrient loaded trembling aspen seedlings can be used to offset early field fertilization needs at forest reclamation sites.@@@Seedling quality

However, little information is available on the response of plantation forest exposed to APRI. To investigate the effects of APRI on WUE and flavonoid accumulation in leaves of ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) seedlings, a split-root experiment was conducted with three irrigation modes: APRI, fixed partial root-zone drip irrigation (FD), and whole root-zone drip irrigation (WD). For each irrigation mode, three irrigation quotas were applied: normal water supply (75 % of the field water-holding capacity), mild drought (55 % of field capacity), and severe drought (35 % of field capacity). APRI increased the root:shoot ratio, feeder root biomass, total biomass, WUE, and leaf flavonoid concentration, but decreased transpiration rate under the mild drought condition compared with that under FD and WD. Linear regression analyses showed that leaf flavonoid concentration was significantly and positively correlated with WUE and root:shoot ratio, but was negatively correlated with total biomass of ginkgo seedlings. On the basis of the improvements in yield, WUE, and flavonoid accumulation observed in this study, we recommend applying the APRI mild-drought treatment for water management in ginkgo leaf-producing plantations.@@@Alternative partial root-zone irrigation

Restoration efforts are challenged by high vulnerability to extreme drought, which is projected to become more frequent with future climate change. The aim of our study was to determine whether restoration efforts could be enhanced through the individual and combined effects of the site preparation technique of soil ripping and the addition of fertilisers. We tested the effects of ripping and fertiliser (±surfactant) on survival, shoot height, crown health, root biomass and leaf physiology of Eucalyptus gomphocephala seedlings in degraded MCEs in Western Australia. Restoration treatments had a much stronger impact under closed canopy (forest) compared to open canopy (woodland) conditions. In the forest, soil ripping doubled seedling survival and together with fertiliser application enhanced shoot height 2.35-fold relative to control seedlings. Ripping resulted in more favourable leaf water potentials and enhanced stomatal conductance suggesting increased water availability compared to unripped soil. In the woodland, fertilisation improved seedling survival and stimulated shoot height (+45 %) and root biomass (>2-fold). Our results demonstrate that restoration techniques targeting the co-limitation by water and nutrients can greatly increase chances of successful restoration in these types of ecosystems.@@@Revegetation

Forest restoration has been identified as a regional conservation priority; in recent decades, native species reforestation projects have proliferated, but little information exists on growth performance of commonly planted tree species in relation to site and soil nutrient status. This study analyzed growth of seven common native species (Alnus acuminata, Baccharis bogotensis, Cedrela montana, Myrica pubesens, Quercus humboltii, Sambucus nigra, Smallanthus pyramidalis) on 12 montane forest sites across the northern region of the tropical Andes. Andean alder (A. acuminata) was the most commonly planted species, and grows at a mean annual diameter increment (MAI-d) of 1.81 cm y−1 and a mean annual height increment (MAI-h) of 0.95 m y−1. S. pyramidalis, a short lived pioneer of the Asteraceae family, also exhibited fast growth rates of 1.64 cm MAI-d and 1.21 m MAI-h. Andean oak (Q. humboltii) was the second-most commonly planted species, growing with an MAI-d of 0.99 cm and MAI-h of 0.56 m. Soil magnesium and potassium were significant predictors of MAI-d and MAI-h for A. acuminata, while soil nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium, and calcium were negatively associated with growth (p < .001). We speculate that A. acuminata did not grow as well on soils richer in calcium and phosphorus because they were less conducive to nitrogen symbiosis common to this species. Soil magnesium and calcium were significant predictors (p < .05) of diameter growth for Q. humboltii. For both species, we attribute growth responses to soil nutrients as a result of the variable nature of fertility in the complex and variable soils that make up the volcanic and surficial geological landscape of the northern Andes. Results indicate that native species can grow in a variety of soil conditions, and exhibit growth rates comparable to non-native species. However, our results suggest native species are site restricted for best growth and should be planted on particular soils. We make recommendations for reforestation for the species in this study.@@@Restoration

Don) Endl.) plantings in New Zealand are increasing due to favourable growth rates. There is, however, very limited information on S. sempervirens genetics on which to build breeding and deployment decisions. In this study we present results from the assessment of growth, wood density, heartwood area, and epicormic shoots in two replicated clonal provenance trials of 170 S. sempervirens clones at two sites. Across-site genetic correlations among provenance for traits were high, 0.9 or above, with the exception of 0.7 for epicormic shoots. Medium-to-high genetic control was expressed for all growth and wood property traits. Broad-sense heritabilities for the two sites assessed were: diameter at breast height (1.4 m) (0.35 and 0.52), wood density (0.52 and 0.30), and percentage heartwood (0.40 and 0.50). Epicormic shoots were under low genetic control (0.11 and 0.27) and may be more influenced by the environment. Genetic correlations between traits showed that growth rate was negatively correlated with wood density (−0.52 to −0.58). Faster growth was also correlated with more epicormic shoots (0.36–0.44). We found no strong trends between growth performance, provenance location, or provenance site characteristics of the material tested. In contrast to earlier research in the United States of America, this study found a high clonal repeatability for the above traits and it demonstrated a low genotype × environment interaction. This study provides important and new insights in the genetic variability of S. sempervirens provenances.@@@Sequoia sempervirens

To determine the importance of these characteristics on the growth and development of the seedlings, we simulated two levels of water availability [650 mm year−1 (W650) and 1000 mm year−1 (W1000)], two levels of light [representing full (PPF100) and low sunlight (80 % reduction of sunlight, PPF20) conditions] and three soil compaction depths [soil compaction at depth 60 cm (C60), 25 cm (C25) and 10 cm (C10)]. Seedling emergence and survival were determined, along with various biometric characteristics. Emergence rate was only significantly affected by the water availability treatment, being significantly lower in W650. No differences were found in the other treatments. Seedlings grown under high PPF presented an increase in biomass. Seedlings grown in the deeper soils (C60) showed deeper and thinner roots. The results show increased survival of seedlings grown under low PPF and high water availability. Our results obtained in this greenhouse study support the hypothesis of facilitation, which considers that under drought conditions the promoting effect of water balance induced by the shade is more positive for the survival of the seedlings. We cannot say whether there are one or more independent factors that will limit or enhance the natural regeneration of Q. ilex, which implies that the effects of some can be mitigated, compensated for or amplified depending on the interaction with other elements. Knowledge of these interactions and the environmental variability of habitats at a smaller scale can be a powerful tool for promoting the growth of native vegetation and conservation of the Mediterranean area and dry environments.@@@Acorn

The aim of the experiment was to investigate whether different growth light spectra during pre-cultivation of Scots pine and Norway spruce seedlings under controlled conditions affect growth and morphology of seedlings, and whether the possible differences between the treatments will be maintained after outplanting to a field site. The seedlings were pre-cultivated for 5.5–6.5 weeks in a darkened greenhouse under four light spectra consisting of different proportions of blue (B, 400–500 nm), red (R, 600–700 nm), and far-red (FR, 700–800 nm), with high-pressure sodium lamps (HPS) serving as controls. The light treatments (250 µmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetically active radiation) were provided using light-emitting diodes, and the treatments included the following: (1) 25 % B + 70 % R + 5 % FR; (2) 25 % B + 75 % R; (3) 55 % B + 45 % R; and (4) HPS: 6 % B + 44 % green (500–600 nm) + 41 % R + 9 % FR (control). Growth and morphology were studied at the time of transplanting in spring, and again, at the time of outplanting the seedlings in the field site in autumn. Growth, survival and phenology of the seedlings were followed in the field for 1 year. Growth and morphology of the seedlings were modified by the different growth light spectra during pre-cultivation, but by the time of outplanting, these differences between the treatments had disappeared. In conclusion: Growth and morphology of seedlings can be modified by adjusting the spectral composition of growth light during pre-cultivation, but the modifications may not be long-lasting.@@@Container seedling

This is also the case in Latvia, where former agricultural land is either artificially afforested or taken over by the natural process of secondary succession. A large spatial and temporal variety of succession and compositional diversity of tree species colonizing fields is observed in the central part of Latvia. Understanding of the possible scenarios in the development of plant communities after land abandonment is important for deciding on viable management solutions, e.g. restoration of semi-natural grasslands or forest regeneration. The aim of the research was to determine the factors affecting the course of secondary succession at its initial stage and the composition of tree species that are colonizing abandoned fields. Ten abandoned fields were surveyed, recording species composition and vegetation structure, determining soil properties and analysing correlations between these factors. The research results help to explain the mechanisms of how soil properties affect the course of succession. On fertile soils a dense herbaceous layer developed, which in abandoned fields resulted in accumulation of a thick cover of litter. Such conditions hinder establishment of typical pioneer species, e.g. grey alder Alnus incana, aspen Populus tremula and birch Betula pendula, whereas Norway spruce Picea abies is able to compete with grass species and thus can more easily establish in abandoned fields, creating favourable conditions for invasion by other tree species.@@@Forest regeneration

We studied fallow forests formed as a consequence of Karen swiddeners in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar, assessing above- and belowground biomass recovery and soil carbon storage in fallow forests using a chronosequence approach. The accumulated total biomass was 12.13–356.95 Mg ha−1, the accumulated carbon stock was 5.70–167.77 Mg C ha−1, and the soil carbon stock was 5.70–167.77 Mg C ha−1 in the fallow forests. Our analysis suggested that the fallow forests in this study should recover to the total biomass accumulation of old forests after 20–35 years. We established a curve of total biomass accumulation in the fallows against age that can be easily used when the age of the fallows is known. Based on soil carbon analysis, total carbon storage fluctuated with fallow age and decreased with soil depth. The overall soil carbon accumulation in fallow forest soil was 43.63–70.11 Mg ha−1. This study contributes to the understanding of fallow forest and swidden agricultural system carbon stocks and can be used for planning future agreements, such as Reducing Emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+), at national and regional levels.@@@Allometries

We studied the effect of such hybrid/non-hybrid mixtures on the productivity and quality of young plantations, through a three-step process: determination of tree species identity with cytoplasmic DNA markers, comparison of hybrid and non-hybrid tree performance, and finally, assessment of thinning impact on hybrid percentage. Overall, we analyzed progenies from eight commercial seed orchards at three sites. Huge variations in hybrid percentage were found among orchard progenies. Globally, the results concerning survival, susceptibility to drought and to Meria laricis, growth, stem form and wood stiffness were clearly in favor of hybrids. In particular, they grew faster than the non-hybrid trees and exhibited a more homogeneous growth than the mixed progenies. Hybrid superiority was highest for orchards composed of a single maternal clone of a species which was poorly adapted to the planting site. Hybrid percentage was enhanced by successive thinnings. However, a serious loss of income is expected when planting progenies characterized by low initial hybrid percentage and high hybrid superiority. Moreover, variations in hybrid percentage proved to be problematic in seed orchard testing as seed orchard ranking may change depending on whether it is based on the performance of all trees or hybrids only. These variations reduce the reliability of the recommendations typically made to forest owners. For commercial and silvicultural reasons, we suggest setting a minimal threshold level of 60–70 % for hybrid percentage in marketed forest reproductive materials.@@@Hybrid larch

In this study, we investigated the impacts of above- and belowground competition on seedling growth and allometry in a tropical monsoon forest (TMF) on Hainan Island, China. Four common dominant canopy tree species from three forest types (Schima superba in secondary forest, Peltophorum tonkinense and Vatica mangachapoi in lowland rainforest, and Terminalia nigrovenulosa in TMF) were planted in different treatments (understory vegetation removal and trenching to decrease above- and belowground competition, respectively). Three species had greater relative growth rates in height in the vegetation removal, but not in the trenching treatment. Vegetation removal reduced mortality rates for all species and increased biomass in three of the four. Trenching alone did not affect biomass for any species. Vegetation removal affected seedling allometry, resulting in higher leaf mass fraction in the lowland rainforest species P. tonkinense and V. mangachapoi. The secondary forest species, S. superba, did not successfully establish in plots with intact understory because of aboveground competition. The highly drought-adapted traits of T. nigrovenulosa allowed its seedlings to establish successfully in TMF, where it is a canopy dominant. Our results demonstrate that aboveground competition is more important than belowground competition in structuring seedling communities in TMF, because light availability largely limits seedling establishment in this ecosystem.@@@Biomass

A fertilization treatment carried out in early spring 2009 and in variable weather conditions caused between-year differences in acorn yield and production of second and third flush shoots. A total of 10 linear calibration equations were constructed based on data from leaves sampled in early July (first flush leaves), in mid-August (second flush leaves) and in mid-September (first and second flush leaves). These equations reliably described (p < 0.001) the relationships between chlorophyll content index values (CCI) measured by the chlorophyll meter and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) with respect to the year and month of sampling. The results suggest that variable seasonal dynamics of LNC are influenced by second and/or third flushes as well as by acorn yield. This finding has negative consequences for applying the chlorophyll meter as a suitable tool for LNC assessments during a growing season or over several growing seasons. However, the chlorophyll meter still proved to be a potentially useful tool for LNC estimations, but only when calibration equations were constructed based on the first flush leaves sampled in mid-September (in the last third of a growing season).@@@Chlorophyll meter

Smith is a native species commonly used in small-scale reforestation programs in Costa Rica recognized for its fast growth under acidic and unfertile soil conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the nutrient concentration dynamics on individual trees of V. guatemalensis of increasing ages, in order to improve the understanding some aspects of its ecology as well as management of this tree species. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and B) and Al concentration in stems, branches and foliage were measured using false time series (also known as chronosequences) in 13 different tree stands (2–21 years) found in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. N, K and S concentrations in the stems showed a significant inverse relationship with DBH; while P, S, and Cu foliar contents increased with DBH. Average foliar concentrations of N, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, B, and Al showed little or no variation with tree growth. Foliar Al concentration (21, 297–28, 826 mg kg−1) was higher than previously reported as toxic for non-Al accumulating species (<1000 mg kg−1), confirming V. guatemalensis as an Al hyper accumulator. Our results reinforce the possibility of using V. guatemalensis for timber production, especially to improve the income of small farmers farming on very acidic soils. The nutrient concentrations that were obtained for different tree components provide baseline information for further studies where the objective is to evaluate the nutritional status of a site.@@@White Yemeri

However, few studies have investigated tree planting to reclaim metalliferous mine tailings. To mitigate the restrictions to tree growth associated with mine tailings, soils and amendments can be used. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in low-sulphur thickened tailings of a gold mine under boreal conditions. We aimed to select the best substrate to establish multispecies plantations. We compared the effects of (1) increasing the topsoil volume and thickness, (2) amending tailings and overburden with greenwaste compost, and (3) direct planting in the tailings on the establishment of Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch, Pinus banksiana Lamb., Salix viminalis L., and P. × canadensis Moench × P. maximowiczii A. Henry. Trees did not survive the first winter when planted directly in tailings, but compost addition to tailings increased survival through substrate structure improvement. However, survival and growth remained lower for three species planted in the compost and tailings mixture compared to soil treatments. Tree roots did not colonize tailings underlying the compost and tailings mixture, whereas roots were present in tailings underlying soil layers. In overburden amended with compost, survival and growth rates were similar to those for trees planted in topsoil of the same thickness. Adding compost to tailings or mineral soil improved the P nutrition of trees, which appeared a limiting nutrient in this study. Tree growth was influenced by topsoil thickness (50 vs. 20 cm) rather than volume (20 cm layer vs. 20 cm deep planting holes); trees grown in the thicker topsoil showed the highest N nutrition and aerial growth.@@@Mine revegetation

Koch) seeds is a major hurdle for production of the desired quantity of seedlings in nurseries for restoration purpose. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an optimal dormancy breaking treatment and subsequent stimulation of germination. The treatments applied were cold stratification at 1 °C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks; warm stratification at 20 °C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification; exogenous application of 250, 500, and 1000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) and 6-Benzylamino purine (BAP); and a combination of 500 ppm hormones and cold stratification. The results show significant differences in germination between cold and warm-cold stratification, length of stratification and their interaction (p < 0.01). Warm stratification for 16 weeks followed by 12 weeks of cold stratification induced 72 % of the seeds to germination in 12 days compared with 16-week cold-stratification alone (42 %) and the control (8 %). Exogenous application of GA3 and BAP alone or in combination with cold stratification resulted in less than 50 % germination though significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the control. Apparently, the hormone treatments alone or in combination with cold stratification are not effective in completely breaking dormancy and stimulation of germination. The findings suggest that J. polycarpos seeds may possess intermediate simple morpho-physiological dormancy, which could be an adaptive mechanism for relatively warmer autumn temperature during seed maturation and the subsequent cold winter temperature under natural conditions.@@@Iran

One explanation could be low pH-levels. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to test the development of available poplar clones on soils with different soil acidity. The study was divided into two parts. In study A, poplar cuttings were planted in peat soil with pH-levels ranging from 3.4 to 5.7. In study B, the same plant material was planted in forest soils collected from different sites with different pH levels. Both studies were carried out in a greenhouse. Soil acidity had a significant effect on plant development. With increasing pH, height and biomass of the poplar clones increased. A difference in allocation between root and aboveground biomass was seen among treatments with more biomass directed above ground at higher pH. This pattern was more pronounced with increasing plant weight. Less Al and more Ca were found in leaves from plants grown in soils with higher pH, but P was low overall in the forest soil. Results from this study show that low pH-values can hamper the establishment of poplar. The availability of Ca, P and Al is also of importance, since they could counteract or increase the adverse effects of low pH-levels.@@@Cuttings

The issue is significant for Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis Blume.) which is grown in cost-effective polybags. In this study we examined how copper root pruning and radicle pruning (1/3 or 2/3 of radicle length) individually and together (1/3 radicle pruning in combination with copper root pruning) affected root architecture, growth and nutrient storage of nursery seedlings, and survival, growth performance and nutrient status during the first outplanting season. Copper root pruning failed to reduce root spiraling, and decreased total root length and surface area by decreasing root length and surface area of roots with diameter <5 mm. In contrast, radicle pruning decreased root deformation and induced taproot formation. However, intensity of radicle pruning impacted seedling size at planting and 2/3 radicle pruning decreased height and stem dry mass relative to the control. Root effects of combination (radicle plus copper root pruning) treatment on root development were not superior to 1/3 radicle pruning. Combination treatment decreased roots with diameter <2 mm. Overall 1/3 radicle pruning has the best potential to modify root development for vigorous-rooted Chinese cork oak seedlings grown in polybags.@@@Root spiraling

Planting machines plant seedlings deeper. While machine planting has become more common in boreal forests, there is still a need to demonstrate that conifer seedlings can be planted using this method without reduced field performance of seedlings. To investigate the effects of deep planting on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) container seedlings, we established two experiments in Central Finland in 2006 and 2009. In the experiment on a site with medium coarse soil, planting depths were 0, 2, 5 and 8 cm. In the experiment established on fine-textured soil, planting depths were 3, 6 and 10 cm. During the first 4 years after planting, deeper planted seedlings grew better and at the end of the fourth season initial differences in shoot length among planting depths had disappeared. Incidence of insect damage was relatively low, and no differences among planting depths were found. During the dry summer, there was a positive relationship between increased planting depth and improved survivability of seedlings. In conclusion, deep planting improved growth of Norway spruce seedlings and was an advantage in dry conditions.@@@Black spruce beetle

To determine vegetation response to these disturbances, we constructed grazing exclosures bisecting the forest-grassland ecotone at five sites and measured species richness in nested plots for four treatments (grazed forest, ungrazed forest, grazed grassland, and ungrazed grassland) over 18 months. Species-area curves revealed greater small-scale species richness in grasslands than forests but greater rates of species accumulation in forests and thus little difference in richness between habitats at larger scales. Temporally, small-scale richness differed among sample dates, but rates of species accumulation did not. The interactive effect of habitat and management on total species richness varied with times since the exclosures were built. Grazing and afforestation interactively affect the vegetation of the Campos, as plants respond to changes in both disturbances; over the duration of this study, the removal of grazing decreased species richness in grasslands but increased richness in forests. Our results illustrate that the response of plant species richness to grazing and afforestation varies by the nature of the disturbance mechanism, and that multiple disturbances have complex interactive effects on vegetative responses.@@@Campos

Genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinases, which can degrade fungal cell wall components, are attractive candidates for improving disease resistance. This report describes a reliable and efficient protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of somatic embryos of European chestnut with the endogenous CsCh3 gene that codes for chitinase. The transformation efficiency, determined on the basis of the fluorescence of surviving explants, was genotype-dependent. Although somatic embryos of all three lines evaluated were transformed, the best results were obtained with somatic embryos derived from line CI-9 (20 %). The addition of silver thiosulphate (20 or 40 μM) improved the transformation efficiency of somatic embryos derived from lines CI-3 and CI-9, although the differences were not significant. A total of 88 independent transformed lines were obtained. The presence of transgenes was confirmed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, PCR and Southern blot analysis. Transgenic lines were maintained by secondary embryogenesis or cryopreservation following vitrification procedures. Maturation and germination of transformed somatic embryos yielded transgenic plants. Fluorescence indicating overexpression of the transgenes was observed in somatic embryos and also in shoots and leaves. No phenotypic differences were found relative to control plants, suggesting a lack of any cytotoxic effects of the GFP.@@@Agrobacterium tumefaciens

Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we produced 94 transgenic transformation events in four hybrid genotypes (three Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoides and one of P. trichocarpa × P. nigra). These lines were screened for high levels of tolerance in two plantations in Oregon. Based on screening results, we propagated four lines from two hybrid genotypes to study their value for weed control and productivity in a 2-year management trial in eastern Oregon, comparing conventional weed control at the time of the study to methods that included over-the-top applications of glyphosate during the growing season. Herbicide tolerance was stable in all of the trees over the 2-year period. Weed control, based on weed abundance, was substantially improved in the over-the-top application. Growth of the trees, as measured by stem volume index, was correspondingly improved; transgenic trees grew approximately 20 % faster than the transgenic and non-transgenic control trees. An exploratory life-cycle analysis of the embodied greenhouse-gas benefits for a coppice bioenergy plantation suggested that over a 6-year rotation with three coppice cycles, the growth improvement could provide an ~8 % savings in greenhouse gas emissions per unit of wood produced. Despite the potential benefits, adoption of this technology will depend on compatibility with management regimes, regulatory and market acceptance, and probably also the development of a robust transgene containment system.@@@Populus

The objectives were to (1) test the negative effect of the invasive buckthorn on seedling growth, (2) determine if this effect differed for two tree species with different shade tolerances and edaphic requirements (sugar maple, red oak), and (3) determine if the type of canopy influenced this effect (5 clones). Confounding factors were reduced in this design (canopy composition and structure, age/size of seedlings), and several factors were controlled (transplantation date, deer exclusion). Several factors were measured (canopy openness, soil nutrients, canopy biomass, understory vegetation biomass, buckthorn density and biomass). After two growing seasons, seedlings of both species had reduced diameter and height increments under buckthorn. This difference was statistically significant for diameter increment. Canopy type did not have any effect on environmental variables or seedling growth. Buckthorn reduced light availability, but had no effect on soil moisture or soil nutrient availability. Consistent with sugar maple’s ecological requirements, its diameter growth was explained (multiple regression) firstly by edaphic variables (positive effect: soil humidity and K), and secondly by buckthorn biomass (negative effect). Red oak growth was explained firstly by buckthorn biomass, and secondly by understory vegetation biomass, both negative effects. Seedlings of species with higher light requirements (red oak) may have large growth reductions under buckthorn cover and have difficulty overtopping it. These results indicate that under-planting (plantations, forests) or afforestation should occur rapidly after buckthorn removal, otherwise this introduced invasive shrub may greatly reduce survival and growth of planted trees. Restoration of red oak to areas of former abundance will likely be more difficult because of the competition from glossy buckthorn.@@@Frangula alnus

"891","Complex impacts of logging residues on planted hybrid poplar seedlings in boreal ecosystems@@@@@@Received: 24 December 2015 Accepted: 30 July 2016 Published: 31 August 2016 Issue Date: November 2016@@@We studied three hybrid poplar plantations in Quebec (Canada) established on sites with varying soil and environmental characteristics to investigate the effects of logging residues on the water potential, carbon isotope ratio and foliar nutrients of planted trees. On each site, four treatments representing different residue loads, as well as treatments aimed at manipulating specific factors of the environment (Herbicide, Geotextile) were applied to test their effects on seedling water potential, carbon isotope ratio and foliar nutrients. Along with analyses of variance, we used structural equation modelling to infer causal relationships of logging residues on height, basal diameter and foliar nutrition of trees through their effects on soil temperature, soil water content and competing vegetation cover. Logging residues decreased soil temperature at all sites and woody plants cover at one site out of three. Height, basal diameter and unit leaf mass were strongly related to each other. Foliar δ13C, N concentration and unit leaf mass increased with decreasing cover of woody plants suggesting an important role of competition for resources. Overall, logging residues had no direct influence on hybrid poplar dimensions after two growing seasons: their effects on the microenvironment of this resource demanding tree species were either cancelling out each other, or were not significant enough to have a significant impact on the growth drivers measured. For example, presence of logging residues might reduce soil temperature, impeding overall seedling performance. Our study highlights the fact that any given silvicultural method aimed at manipulating logging residues has a complex influence involving the interaction of multiple environmental drivers and that the net effect on tree productivity will depend on species and site specific conditions.@@@Structural equation modelling (SEM)

Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted with forest plantations in tropical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the soil fertility, mineral nutrition and tree growth in Eucalyptus grandis plantations fertilized with three types of sewage sludge. The design used was of blocks with randomized plots, four replications and five treatments: control without fertilization (C), conventional mineral fertilizer (MF), fertilization with 15 t ha−1 (dry basis) of sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants of Barueri (BS), São Miguel (SS) and Parque Novo Mundo (PS) cities, all located in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, Brazil. It was observed that the application of sewage sludge increased the content of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in the layer of 0–5 cm soil depth, as well as the nitrogen, phosphorus, copper and zinc concentrations in the Eucalyptus leaves. In the PS treatment, the sludge (conditioned with quicklime) application also increased the pH and the concentration of calcium in the soil compared to other kinds of sludge (conditioned with polyelectrolyte), resulting in higher Ca:Mg and Ca:K ratios in the leaves. Probably for this reason, wood production in PS was 20 % lower than in the MF treatment at 60 months of age of the trees. Even so, the fertilization with sewage sludge provided a rise of 50–90 % in timber volume compared to C treatment.@@@Biosolids

However, it is necessary to identify the environmental factors that affect seed germination and seedling establishment in order to improve the success of this technique. It has been suggested that the establishment of Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae), a threatened tropical montane cloud forest tree species, is associated with microsites of high soil moisture. We assessed seedling emergence in O. mexicana through direct seeding in a secondary forest and characterized the microenvironmental conditions of the sowing microsite. We also assessed the effect of seed hydration on seedling emergence and evaluated the effect of soil moisture content and seed hydration in O. mexicana seed germination and seedling emergence under laboratory conditions. Seedling emergence was lower in the field than in the laboratory (37 vs. 42 %, respectively). At microsite level, seedling emergence correlated positively with soil moisture content but negatively with vegetation cover. After 11 months, 52 % of the emerged seedlings still survived. Under laboratory conditions, seedling emergence did not differ significantly between hydrated and non-hydrated seeds (43.2 ± 0.52 vs. 40.3 ± 0.51 %, respectively), but did between high and low soil moisture contents (80 ± 0.18 vs. 3.5 ± 0.085 %, respectively). With appropriate soil moisture and vegetation cover conditions, O. mexicana seed introduction into secondary forest is a reliable technique. However, the method could be improved by protecting the seedlings from physical damage.@@@Enrichment planting

This work analyzes the effect of the damage caused by T. nubilosa on tree growth and survival of E. globulus and E. maidenii, based on data from a trial naturally infected by this pathogen. The effect of defoliation and proportion of adult foliage on tree growth and mortality was evaluated at 50 months of age. Defoliation in E. globulus was higher than in E. maidenii, reaching average values of 52.5 and 28.8 %, respectively, at 21 months of age. By contrast, E. globulus showed higher precocity of vegetative phase change than E. maidenii. Although the damage threshold for diameter growth was 40 % on E. globulus and 20 % on E. maidenii, the detrimental effect on growth was similar in both species, where the most defoliated trees suffered a reduction in diameter of 49.4 and 47.5 %, respectively, at 50 months of age. Mortality increased significantly when defoliation exceeded 30 % in E. globulus and 40 % in E. maidenii. The results showed that E. maidenii has lower defoliation, higher growth and lower mortality than E. globulus after epidemics of T. nubilosa. However, the lower defoliation and higher proportion of juvenile foliage showed by E. maidenii represent a greater source of inoculum, suggesting that a large-scale replacement of E. globulus by E. maidenii in areas where T. nubilosa is a problem could be risky from an epidemiological point of view.@@@Mycosphaerella leaf disease

After 175 days of growth, our results showed considerable variation in growth traits among container types while survival was generally high with an overall average of 89 %. Initial cutting diameter appeared to be an important predictor of survival and our results showed that a cutting diameter of ≥7.5 mm increased survival rates of the tested hybrid poplar planting stock. Furthermore, containers with larger cavity volume and lower cavity density had a strong positive influence on growth and survival across nurseries (R 2 = 0.96). Growth trait interactions with container type showed that container 512A (cavity volume: 220 ml; cavity depth: 12 cm) resulted in more diameter growth across clones. Cavities with a depth of 15 cm (415D, 515A, 615A) resulted in higher root:shoot ratios than cavities with a depth of only 12 cm (412A, 512A), irrespective of cavity volume or cavity density. Lastly, our study identified Okanese as a well-rounded clone with great growth potential both above and below ground. From an operational standpoint, we found container types 512A and 515A the most cost-effective choices under the assumption that nursery space and budgets are limiting factors.@@@Boreal forest

Schima superba, an excellent shade-tolerant and fire-resistant species, is believed to be more resistant to soil acidification than Masson pine. Accordingly, its saplings were often grown in acidified and declining Masson pine stands to transform them and enhance prevention and control of forest fires and, in fact, cultivating S. superba saplings under canopies of Masson pine stands growing on acidified soil may be an important measure of forest transformation in the future. But on the other hand, liming is an effective practice to alleviate damage of soil acidification to Masson pine forests. In 2004, we established permanent plots limed with 0 (unlimed control), 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha−1 limestone powder in an acid-damaged (>25 % defoliation) Masson pine stand mixed with S. superba saplings in Chongqing, and observed positive responses of Masson pine growth 8 years after liming. In 2015 we conducted an investigation to assess the effects of liming on the health and growth of young S. superba trees under the canopy of this stand. The results showed that compared to the unlimed control, liming increased pH, exchangeable calcium (Ca), and Ca/Al molar ratio, but decreased exchangeable aluminum (Al) in the 0–20 cm mineral soil layer. As a result, length densites of living fine roots of the young S. superba trees increased, while their defoliation decreased. Over 11 years, mean height increment of the S. superba trees increased from 3.7 m in the unlimed control to 3.8, 4.0, 4.7, and 5.9 m in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha−1 lime treatments, and their mean basal diameter (5 cm above the ground) increment increased from 2.4 to 2.7, 3.2, 3.9, and 4.9 cm, respectively.

Radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) breeding and deployment of genetically improved stock in Australia are currently based on the National Plantation Inventory (NPI) regions. These regions are not based on environmental drivers and biological patterns of genotype by environment interaction (G × E), so they may not deliver optimal genetic gains across plantation areas in Australia. This study used diameter at breast height data from trial sites with common parents to estimate site–site and age–age additive genetic correlations, and compile them into a database. A custom-built script in R was developed, which models the correlation estimates by minimising the weighted error sum of squares from the model to the estimates. First, parameters for the Lambeth’s age–age correlation model were derived to adjust for differences in age between sites. Second, estimates of average site–site additive genetic correlations between and within NPI regions were compared with currently assumed values. Third, to identify new breeding and deployment regions, sites were sequentially divided into groups based on critical values of climate and soil variables. Sites were first split into two clusters based on mean daily minimum temperature of wettest quarter, at a threshold of 9.0 °C, and then within the cool cluster, based on rainfall in March, at a threshold of 68 mm. Variances among breeding values were compared for different site classifications as a measure of potential genetic gain. The results from this study are currently being used to redefine the breeding and deployment regions for radiata pine grown in Australia.@@@Radiata pine

Nutrient solutions containing 0.05, 0.8 or 10 mM Ca were adjusted to pH 4, 5, 6, or 7. Overall, the greatest growth was obtained with nutrient solutions containing 0.8 mM Ca at pH 6. Foliar Ca deficiency symptoms developed at 0.05 mM Ca. Sensitivity of teak clones to Al was tested at pH 4 and 0, 50 or 300 µM Al by staining of roots. Roots that were stained with Chromezurol S (CAS) also stained with hematoxylin, but not necessarily with Eriochrome Cyanine R (ECR). On the other hand, roots that stained with hematoxylin did not necessarily stain with CAS or ECR. This indicates that hydrolysis of Al (as detected by CAS) leads to membrane damage which is detected by hematoxylin. A selection of clones were grown in split pots containing either limed or non-limed soil, and Al activity in the soil solution related to root biomass. Five clones were identified as Al resistant in the solution screening, and two clones were Al resistant in the soil screen, with two clones resisting low pH and Al toxicity in soil and solution screens. This study revealed that some teak clones tolerate low pH soils and moderately toxic 25 µM {Al3+} activity, and may be suitable for poor soils, but soils used in Australia for teak plantations are often too hostile and would require amelioration.@@@Split pot

To enhance the accuracy of such estimations, the development of locally not pantropically—derived reliable allometric models is advised whenever possible, especially for dominant and widely distributed tree species, such as in the Castanopsis carlesii H. (C. carlesii) forests in subtropical China. Here, C. carlesii allometric equations were developed and applied to examine for three subtropical forests: a natural primary forest, an artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest and a C. carlesii plantation. To develop these allometric equations, destructive measurements of architecture and biomass of above- and below-ground components were undertaken for 33 sample trees from 10 dominant species, with stem diameters (at 1.30 m, or above buttresses) ranging from 4 to 67 cm. The mixed-species regressions with only the diameter at breast height as a predictor gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for biomass estimation of foliage, branch and coarse roots; the inclusion of tree height gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for estimation of stem and total biomass. Adding wood density did not improve model performance. Dominant-species regression for C. carlesii was able to predict biomass well using only diameter at breast height as a metric, but adding height and wood density slightly improved the goodness-of-fit, indicating that wood density and tree height may be crucial factors in above- and below-ground biomass models of these subtropical forests. The mixed-species regressions were able to predict well the total biomass of both primary and secondary forests, while the dominant-species models gave a better fit for estimating biomass of the C. carlesii plantation. The biomass estimates of the secondary forest was significantly higher than those of the C. carlesii plantation, indicating that intense forest regeneration practices might cause the reduction of above- and below-ground forest biomass. Therefore, distinct models for the biomass estimation of mixed forests and pure plantation are likely to be needed to improve the accuracy of both biomass assessment protocols and estimations of C sequestration for subtropical forests.@@@Biomass allometric equations

Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) is a fast-growing candidate for cultivation as a short-rotation woody crop for biofuel production and it is planted throughout Asia, Europe, and the Northern America. It is native to the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the South Central United States. The LMAV has climatic, edaphic, and infrastructural attributes conducive to biofuel production, but much of the most productive sites of the region are dedicated to agricultural production because it is the most economically prime use. To foster development of a biofuel industry of the region may require biomass production on sites suboptimal for agricultural production. In this study, cropping systems and genotypes for cottonwood production were tested at three retired agricultural sites in the LMAV, Archibald, Colt, and Rohwer. Cropping systems tested were monoculture and alley cropping systems with two different alley widths. Genotypes tested were clones from Mississippi (ST-66) and Texas (S7C20) and a mixture of clones from Louisiana (LAMIX). Several interactions among site, genotype, and cropping system treatments were detected in survival and growth parameters. By the end of the study period, survival ranged from 30 to 81%, while height and diameter at breast height (dbh) ranges were 3.12–5.78 m, and 2.09–4.39 cm, respectively. Overall, survival and growth performance in this study were low compared to previous studies, suggesting the difficulty of managing productive cottonwood plantations under the suboptimal site conditions tested. Pronounced droughts during half of the years in this study and poor soil conditions were likely the primary reasons behind such performance of the genotypes. The study found no effect of cropping systems on individual tree growth. Genotypes from Texas and Louisiana showed relatively better survival (P = 0.0029) and growth (P < 0.001 to P = 0.0207) than the clone from Mississippi in the site conditions tested. Among sites, Rohwer, which had deep clay soil, had the highest biomass production (8299 kg ha−1). Survival and growth was limited at the Archibald site by ponding of water in winter and early spring in the establishment year and 2 years of pronounced drought in following years. A greater recurrence of competing vegetation at Archibald likely contributed to its lower survival (30%) and growth (biomass ranging from 1026 to 1511 kg ha−1 among the treatments) by the end of the study period. We suggest selecting drought-hardy genotypes along with site preparation and fertilization in such marginal sites.@@@Eastern cottonwood

In this study, we explored the foraging behaviors of seedling predators and seedling survival in the artificial gaps with different sizes and the associated closed canopy forest, to see the influence of rodent predation on seedling establishment of Quercus mongolica. Our results showed that small rodents (Apodemus peninsulae, Clethrionomys rufocanus, Tamias sibiricus and Sciurus vulgaris) tended to avoid recently created gaps in comparison with the associated closed canopy forests. As a consequence, lower levels of seedling predation (i.e., cotyledon removal and shoot clipping) and higher levels of seedling survival were observed in the gaps than in the closed canopy forests. In addition, gaps with large size tended to provide a better shelter for seedlings of Q. mongolica, possibly due to higher predation risks on small rodents in large gaps than in small gaps and the associated closed canopy forests. Our one-year study indicates that small rodents exert strong impacts on the recruitment of Q. mongolica through clipping young seedlings both in the gaps and closed canopy forests. Our study also implies that seedling predation by small rodents is regulated by gap size.@@@Gap size

Three of the local seed sources were seed production areas developed by phenotypic selection for growth from an initial broad base of superior natural provenances, and two were clonal trials. The local seed sources grew significantly faster to 3 years than the natural provenances and the clones. Mean survival at 3 years of the natural provenances (72 %, across the three sites) was better than that of local seed sources (67 %) and clones (50 %). The three types of planting materials did not differ significantly in their wood basic density or NIR-predicted lignin content, while clones had significantly higher NIR-predicted pulp yield. Site mean wood density was highest (579 kg m−3), and pulp yield lowest (43.7 %) at the driest site where growth was slowest, while at the wettest, most productive site, density was 517 kg m−3 and pulp yield 46.5 %. Narrow-sense heritabilities and inter-site genetic correlations for growth and wood traits were moderate to high. Genetic correlations between growth and wood traits did not differ significantly from zero.

In this study, Scots pine seedlings were exposed to waterlogging in fine-textured till soil in growth chambers. The treatments started 5 weeks after germination and lasted either for 3 or 8.5 weeks. Three weeks in water-saturated soil affected negatively the root length, root surface area, root volume, the number of root tips, the length of the longest root, root dry mass, the root to shoot ratio, needle water and nitrogen content, and the apoplastic electrical resistance of the stem. The changes by 3 weeks exposure were recoverable since most of the attributes returned to the level of controls when the oxygen content returned to a normoxic level. In contrast, detrimental, but not lethal, effects of water saturation were observed after exposure for 8.5 weeks. Additional effects of prolonged exposure were a decrease in the potential efficiency of photosystem II, the distribution of absorbed light energy between light reactions and the release as heat by chlorophyll fluorescence, and the chlorophyll content index of the needles. We conclude that prolonged water saturation of fine-textured soil is detrimental to the development of Scots pine seedlings which should be considered in practical forest regeneration.@@@Pinus sylvestris L.

Based on a progeny trial of 115 open-pollinated families of Eucalyptus cloeziana F. Muell., this study estimated the heritability and trait–trait correlations for growth, including height (H), diameter at breast height (D) and volume (V), and wood mechanical traits, including basic density (BD), green density (GD), modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) and parallel-to-grain compressive strength (σc). Narrow-sense heritability (h 2i ) ranged from 0.04 to 0.35 for growth across ages 0.5–9.5 years and from 0.06 to 0.24 for wood mechanical properties at age 9.5, indicating low to moderate magnitude of additive genetic control of these traits. Phenotypic (r p ) and additive genetic (r g ) correlations at the final age of 9.5 years were consistently significantly positive between growth traits and mostly significantly positive between wood mechanical traits, while r p and r g were small and adversely significant, respectively, between the two types of traits, posing a challenge for concomitant improvement of growth and wood traits. In addition, r p and r g coefficients between age 9.5 and earlier years for each of the growth traits H, D and V were all positively significant (except for H 2.5) and had a generally increasing trend with age, suggesting the possibility of early selection.@@@Heritability

It is focused among others on vegetative propagation techniques to capture the superior phenotypes of individual trees. Cola anomala which is a priority target for domestication has been reported amenable to vegetative propagation through rooting of leafy stem cutting, but the rooting efficiency of cuttings collected from non-fertilized stockplants was very poor. The present study addressed the effect of a range of granular NPK 20-10-10 doses (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 g/plant applied at 2-month intervals for 8 months) on growth, total nitrogen content, available carbohydrate content and amino acid content of C. anomala stockplants and the subsequent rooting ability of leafy stem cuttings. Results showed that perseverance fertilizer applications significantly affected growth (p < 0.001), nitrogen content (p < 0.001), carbohydrate content (p = 0.003) and amino acid content (p = 0.001) of stockplant shoots, as well as mortality percentage (p < 0.001), rooting percentage (p = 0.04) and the number of roots (p = 0.02) of subsequently harvested cuttings. The lowest mortality rate (0 %) was associated with the highest rooting percentage (90 ± 7.1 %), while the highest number of roots per rooted cutting (2.61 ± 0.31) was obtained when NPK fertilizer was applied at the rate of 1 g/plant. This dose corresponded to the rate at which stockplant growth was maximized. Of the parameters investigated, only the content of available carbohydrate at the time of excision was significantly correlated with percentage of cuttings rooted (r = 0.90, p = 0.03) and the number of roots per rooted cutting (r = 0.90, p = 0.03). It is concluded that NPK fertilizer applied to stockplants at the rate of 1 g/plant at 2-month intervals for 8 months resulted in the fastest growth and the best rooting ability of subsequently rooted cuttings. This is valuable information to optimize the clonal propagation protocol for C. anomala and other species of the humid tropics of West and Central Africa, especially those considered to be difficult to propagate.@@@Cola anomala

The forest was divided into two site types according to the intensity of grazing (one site of intense grazing and another of lower intensity grazing). In order to analyse the regeneration of the forest, 180 seedling sprouts of both Quercus species, having a height equal to or exceeding 20 cm, were randomly selected under relatively dense groups of trees in both site types. Εach regeneration plant was cut and extracted from a depth of at least 4 cm below the root collar. Many morphological variables such as the diameter at the base of the root collar, the number of living stems, the number of dead basal sprouts, the height and the diameter of the stem base of the tallest (living) stem, and other relative variables were measured (or counted). In addition, height increments of stems in the recent growth period were recorded. Seedling sprouts were mainly multi-stemmed and both species exhibited the same ecological behaviour regarding sprouting. The different grazing intensities did not affect the sprouting ability of Q. pubescens. The results of this study support the significant relation between the root collar diameter and the growth of seedling sprouts. The diameter at the base of the root collar was found to be related to almost all (measured) morphological features of seedling sprouts. This relation was also strong for many characteristics of Q. frainetto. There were somewhat different patterns of morphological relations between the two species.@@@Seedling sprouts

The genetic conservation of tree species is an urgent global necessity as forest conversion and fragmentation continue apace, damaging insects and pathogens are transported between continents, and climate change alters local habitat suitability. Effective and efficient genetic conservation of tree species presents a substantial challenge because of the lack of basic information about many species, inadequate resources, and a historical lack of coordination within and between conservation sectors. Several cooperative efforts are already under way and are achieving conservation success, but much work remains. The Gene Conservation of Tree Species—Banking on the Future workshop in 2016 enabled the exchange of information and the creation of collaborations among tree conservation stakeholders. Several key themes emerged during the meeting’s presentations and dialogue, which are further explored in this paper. In situ conservation of species is the long-term goal and is often the most efficient approach for preserving the genetic diversity of many forest tree species. Whether existing reserves adequately protect species and are sufficient for future conservation needs is uncertain. Ex situ conservation is an important complement to in situ efforts, acting as an insurance measure against extinction, providing material for restoration, enabling additional research opportunities, and educating the public. Networks of botanic gardens, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations must continue to coordinate ex situ and in situ efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tree conservation efforts. Assessing and prioritizing which species and populations require genetic conservation and prioritizing among them is a critical need. Two key tree restoration needs are for wider dissemination of planting stock, particularly stock with resistance to insects and pathogens, and for specific silvicultural prescriptions that facilitate restoration efforts. Effective genetic conservation of forest trees will require ongoing cooperation among widely diverse groups of scientists, managers, and policymakers from the public and private sectors.@@@Ex situ conservation

Picea chihuahuana Martínez is an endangered endemic species known to occur in at least 40 locations along the Sierra Madre Occidental, in the states of Durango and Chihuahua (Mexico), but covering a total area of no more than 300 ha. The total number of individuals has been estimated to be around 42,600, and the number of mature individuals may be <2500. The populations (including mature trees, saplings and seedlings) vary in size from 21 to 5546 individuals. It has been suggested that small populations may be more susceptible to loss of genetic variability via genetic erosion caused by genetic drift, endogamy depression and strong unidirectional selection. The predicted reduction and eventual disappearance of a suitable habitat for P. chihuahuana due to climatic change imposes an additional risk of extinction. The principal aim of this study was therefore to estimate genetic erosion in 14 populations of P. chihuahuana Martínez by comparing genetic diversity across diameter at breast height classes (as a proxy for age classes) by using AFLP markers and four indices of genetic diversity that are commonly applied in combination with dominant genetic markers. No evidence of genetic erosion was found in the 14 P. chihuahuana populations analyzed.@@@Endangered species

Due to insect and disease impacts, changes in fire regimes, and a changing climate, many populations of high elevation white pine species continue to experience high mortality levels and potentially worrisome decreases in genetic variation. In recent years, some trees rated highly for resistance to the non-native white pine blister rust have been killed by fire or mountain pine beetle. Ex situ genetic conservation offers the possibility to conserve the genetic variation within a species before much of it is lost. For many conifer species, freezer storage of seed offers a relatively inexpensive, long-term method of storing germplasm for future use. However, there is uncertainty concerning how long seed of some conifers can be stored and retain viability. We report here on results of germination testing of the oldest known seedlots of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) and foxtail pine (P. balfouriana Grev. & Balf.), some of which had been in storage for several decades. The 52 whitebark pine seedlots averaged 47.7% germination (average seed age of 19.2 years), while the four foxtail pine seedlots had an average germination of 71.3% (average seed age of 15.3 years). Some seedlots of both species had greater than 90% germination. Refinements to the stratification procedure have since been developed which should enhance germination further. A follow-up study examining seedling vigor of long-stored whitebark pine seed is planned.@@@Genetic conservation

"910","Prioritizing conservation seed banking locations for imperiled hemlock species using multi-attribute frontier mapping@@@@@@Received: 15 July 2016 Accepted: 23 February 2017 Published: 01 March 2017 Issue Date: March 2017@@@Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) is an invasive forest insect sweeping across the native range of eastern (Tsuga canadensis [L.] Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlocks, threatening to severely reduce eastern hemlock extent and to push Carolina hemlock to extirpation. HWA poses a significant threat to these eastern US natives, now infesting hemlocks across 19 states and more than 400 counties. For the long-term preservation of the species, ex situ genetic resource conservation efforts such as seed collection, storage, and adelgid-resistant hemlock breeding may all be necessary. To ensure the efficient and effective application of these efforts, it will be necessary to prioritize locations within the native ranges, because it is logistically impossible to apply these efforts to all populations. To build upon 12 years of seed banking for eastern and Carolina hemlock, we applied a novel approach for incorporating multiple dissimilar data sets into a geographic prioritization of areas for the most effective and efficient conservation of genetic diversity. The approach involves integration of geographic information systems with the multi-attribute frontier mapping technique to identify locations across the ranges of these two imperiled species most in need of conservation actions. Specifically, our assessment incorporated four genetic diversity parameters, a climate component, a measure of population disjunctiveness, a measure of local hemlock abundance, and seed collection density to prioritize areas of eastern and Carolina hemlock occurrence for ex situ gene conservation. For each species, the result was a mapped index of locations prioritized by the combined significance of these factors. For eastern hemlock, this assessment assigned the highest priority to disjunct populations and to some areas within the main-body range. With Carolina hemlock, disjunct northern populations and central main-body locations received the highest prioritization. Our prioritization approach could be applied similarly to other species facing pressure from invasive pests or other environmental threats.@@@Eastern hemlock

Dispersal models are shifting towards meso-scale transport processes so I assert here that this shift in transport scale is important to population genetics assumptions inherent to gene conservation decision-making. Support comes from the following: (1) aerodynamic properties for pollen is more akin to spores than seeds. (2) Gradient-free dispersal is typical of pollen transported at meso-scale distances. (3) Importance of vertically uplifted pollen on meso-scale transport has been overlooked and its interaction with atmospheric processes is not yet understood. (4) A fraction of pine pollen retains its capacity for germination and seed fertilization after meso-scale transport. These findings raise the question of whether forest fragmentation aligns with genetics theory of small populations; this question shapes ex situ and in situ collections. The shift to meso-scale transport of pine pollen can re-shape forest gene conservation decision-making about ex situ and in situ collection strategies.@@@Male gametophyte

Reliable evaluations of genetic structure require sound sampling schemes because inappropriate sampling may over- and under-estimate spatial patterns of genetic structure. Sampling bias has been investigated through computer simulations mostly for animal species with continuous distributions. For tree species that have different life history traits, results from such studies may not apply. Here, I used spatially explicit landscape genetic simulations to assess the effects of spatial sampling scheme (random, systematic, and cluster), sampling intensity (35, 50, 65, and 80%), and the number of microsatellite loci (8, 14, and 20) on inferences of genetic structure under isolation by distance (IBD) in two forest tree species with varying dispersal distances and patchy distributions. Results showed that random sampling with 20 loci was the best performing sampling scheme, irrespective of sampling intensity and the strength of IBD. In contrast, the cluster and systematic sampling were sensitive to sample size. For the three sampling schemes, the number of loci had a large effect because with 8 loci there was an increasing chance of underestimating IBD. Increasing the number of samples over the number of loci, did not improve the performance of sampling schemes. Hence, researchers should put more effort on increasing the number of loci over increasing sample size. Results also showed that sampling error rates varied between species, and sampling bias appeared stronger for the species with a more aggregated spatial distribution.@@@Microsatellites

Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines are long-lived, exhibit delayed maturation, have low genetic diversity, and inhabit cold, high-elevation environments. They are threatened by the non-native disease white pine blister rust, warming temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and altered disturbance regimes. The goal of this work was to (1) sample the range-wide genetic diversity of bristlecone pine for ex situ seed and tissue collections and research before the populations are impacted, (2) assess the health and ecological conditions of the species across its geographic range (61 stands) to provide a baseline by which to evaluate future changes, and (3) assess relationships between stand and regeneration characteristics and topographic, geographic, and climatic factors to identify vulnerabilities and proactive management interventions to increase population resilience. Local variation in topoclimate was strongly related to stand structure, composition, health, and regeneration. Bristlecone pine currently showed only minor impacts from insects and pathogens, but relationships between cone production and regeneration with climate variables suggest vulnerabilities to projected climate change. Both cone production and seedling regeneration were also linked to stand structure and ground cover that provide opportunities for proactive in situ management to increase population size to mitigate potential future climate- and pathogen-driven declines. These efforts represent the first proactive coordinated range-wide genetic collection design and forest health assessment for a threatened, but not yet impacted, tree species and offers a model for other species at risk.@@@Ex situ conservation

Scientists and managers from throughout the United States Forest Service have cooperated to develop a framework for conservation priority-setting assessments of forest tree species. This framework uses trait data and predictions of expected climate change pressure to categorize and prioritize 339 native tree species for conservation, monitoring, management and restoration across all forested lands in the contiguous United States and Alaska. The framework allows for the quantitative grouping of species into vulnerability classes that may require different management and conservation strategies for maintaining the adaptive genetic variation of the species within each group. This categorization is based on risk factors relating to the species’ (1) exposure to climate change, (2) sensitivity to climate change, and (3) capacity to adapt to climate change. We used K-means clustering to group species into seven classes based on these three vulnerability dimensions. The most vulnerable class encompassed 35 species with high scores for all three vulnerability dimensions. These will require the most immediate conservation intervention. A group of 43 species had high exposure and sensitivity, probably requiring conservation assistance, while a group of 69 species had high exposure and low adaptive capacity, probably needing close monitoring. This assessment tool should be valuable for scientists and managers determining which species and populations to target for monitoring efforts and for pro-active gene conservation and management activities.@@@Gene conservation

Rudd] growing in the wild and in planted populations outside the natural range@@@@@@Received: 28 June 2016 Accepted: 04 January 2017 Published: 10 January 2017 Issue Date: March 2017@@@Yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild, but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban “population” had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations, and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations.@@@Ex situ conservation

Allele frequencies varied among pre-settlement clumps, with trees more closely related to each other within clumps. This clumpy spatial stand structure typical of reference conditions thus represents “genetic neighborhoods” and suggests restoration of clumpy versus more evenly dispersed trees in naturally regenerating stands will protect evolutionary genetic patterns. Compared to pre-settlement populations, post-settlement trees had slightly greater heterozygosity, and allelic richness and allele frequencies varied between these two age groups. These genetic differences could have resulted from different selective conditions under which the two age groups became established. Genetic diversity of populations created using different selection criteria for residual post-settlement trees did not vary but simulated removal of 75% of post-settlement trees decreased allelic richness. Maintaining more clumps created from post-settlement populations with higher tree densities across the landscape would be more effective at conserving allelic richness. Overall results of this study indicate use of genetic structure and diversity can help guide restoration treatments to help ensure adaptive potential is conserved.@@@Ponderosa pine

We summarize progress and outline future steps in two approaches: (1) a system of hybridizing with a blight-resistant chestnut species and then backcrossing repeatedly to recover the American type and (2) transformation of American chestnut with a resistance-conferring transgene followed by propagation and conventional breeding. Several decades of effort have been invested in each approach. More work remains, but results indicate that success is within practical reach. The restoration of C. dentata to its native habitat now appears to be less a matter of time and conjecture than ever before in 90 years of work by public and private entities. The difficult and protracted task of incorporating extraspecific genes for resistance into a tree species with lethal susceptibility to a naturalized pathogen represents perhaps the most extreme of restoration challenges. Its pursuit by a small non-governmental organization supported primarily by philanthropy and volunteers may serve as a model for other species threatened by exotic pathogens or insects.@@@Castanea dentata

We explored single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in candidate genes for budburst and drought resistance in beech populations sampled across most of the distribution range, represented in an international provenance trial. SNP variation was monitored for six candidate genes, in 114 individuals from 19 natural populations. Population structure was deduced from the analysis of 20 nuclear microsatellite markers. Different methods to detect imprints of natural selection were used (F ST-outlier, SNP-climate regression, association tests). The F ST-outlier approach identified the COV gene with unambiguous signal of selection, which is an orthologue of Arabidopsis gene for a membrane protein previously reported as phenology-related. Based on environmental association analysis at the population level, the dehydrin gene was found associated with drought-related climatic variables. At the individual level, dehydrin gene also showed a significant association with chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which are considered stress markers. The importance of the knowledge of physiological variation and geographical patterns of adaptive genetic variation for guiding reproductive materials transfer under climate change is stressed.@@@Single-nucleotide polymorphisms

The plantations were established by pulp companies in a large area comprising three soil types (Acrisols, Vertisols and Leptosols) in the grassland biome in southern Brazil, and an operational regime of planting and maintenance fertilization was used to ensure full availability of nutrients. Vertisols showed the highest availability of soil nutrients, and the P and Ca concentrations in aboveground biomass were also highest in this type of soil. The nutritional status of both species indicates great consumption of nutrients, particularly of P, K and Ca. At this early age, canopy biomass components still made the largest relative contribution, although debarked stem biomass already accounted for 41.5% and 37.4 of total aboveground biomass in E. saligna, and E. urograndis, respectively. Nutrient concentrations in biomass components were similar across species. For all macronutrients, except Ca and Mg, the concentration gradient followed the order wood < bark < branches < leaves. For all micronutrients, except Cu, the concentration gradient followed the order wood < branches ≈ bark < leaves. At the plantation stage studied, i.e. before canopy closure, the importance of the components as nutrient pools followed the order leaves > branches > wood > bark. The branches hold the majority of Ca reserves in biomass and are a very important pool of Mg, K, P and B. The bark makes a small contribution to total biomass, but stores a similar amount of Ca as leaves, being the second major pool after the branches. Comparison of the nutrients supplied by fertilization and the amounts stored in soil and aboveground indicates that the operational dose should be adjusted to each type of soil after further experimental fertilizer trials, as the supply of N and P appears to be too high, particularly for Vertisols. This is leading to the immobilization of P in biomass components that are not of importance in the biological or biochemical nutrient cycles, thus increasing the risk of larger exports of P during biomass removal.@@@Grassland biome

We investigated pollen flow, the mating system and the level of pollen contamination in a clonal seed orchard of Schima superba Gardn. et Champ. In total, 328 open-pollination progenies coming from 11 mother trees were identified using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci. A total of 203 full-sib families were identified and were nested among the 11 studied seed donors. The male reproductive success rate from 0.49 to 7.77% for most male parents, with an average of 2.44%. More than 80% of the crosses were found within a distance of 60 m, and the most frequent pollination distance between female parent and male parents was approximately 20 m. Mating system analysis showed that the outcrossing level was very high (t m = 1.000, outcrossing rate = 98.5%) in the seed orchard and that there was an average of 2.3 effective pollen donors (N ep ) per female parent. In addition, the mating success of individual males within neighborhoods was moderately influenced by their fecundity and the direction of their location relative to mother trees. The pollen contamination from outside the seed orchard was high (7.01%). Our findings are valuable for the assessment of seed orchards, and it may be worthwhile to use pollen management strategies to decrease pollen contamination and increase the genetic quality of the seeds produced.@@@Schimia superba Gardn. et Champ.

The most common weeding techniques are repeatedly applied herbicides and removable plastic mulching, both raising environmental concerns. We studied the performance of these techniques on a hybrid walnut plantation, compared with three biodegradable mulch alternatives: a prototype bioplastic film, a layer of composted woodchips and a layer of ramial chips. The durability and effect of the treatments on tree performance (survival, growth, physiological traits) and soil features (moisture and temperature) were evaluated over 4 years. Herbicide yielded the best results, while all the mulching treatments provided better results than controls for nearly all the variables. The performance of plastic and bioplastic films was similar, suggesting that the latter could replace plastic mulching. The performance of the two chip mulches was similar and slightly below that of the films, probably because of the excessive thickness of the former (13–14 cm). In summary, biodegradable mulches showed high effectiveness in controlling weeds and so could offer an alternative to herbicide application and plastic mulching when these are contra-indicated technically (accessibility, repeatability), economically (labour cost), legally or environmentally.@@@Afforestation

They are usual mechanisms in deciduous and conifer trees that occur in Mediterranean regions where drought periods are usual. Soil factors, environmental characteristics and species factors are key drivers of nutrient retranslocation in conifers but is not well understood how soil fertility or intraspecific competition influences the process. We studied retranslocation in Pinus halepensis Mill. stands showing different site quality (differences in climate and intraspecific competition) occurring in Southeast Spain. We monitored reforested mature Aleppo pine forests in stands with differences in site quality, climate and intraspecific competition. Stands were characterised, the content of nutrients of soil and green samples (twigs and pine needles) were recorded, and seasonal nutrient retranslocation was obtained. Site characteristics were related to growth rate and nutrient content of foliage and soil. We evaluated whether the retranslocation of nutrients from older to younger foliage was related to the current-year growth rate and to the nutritional status of the plant as influenced by intraspecific competition. Foliar macronutrient concentrations and the amount of retranslocated macronutrients were seasonal, with differences related to site quality and tree density. As a general trend, nutrient concentrations increased after drought (autumn) and decreased during the growth period (spring). However, some micronutrients (mainly Na and Fe) decreased during both periods. The retranslocation pattern in Aleppo pine reinforced the hypothesis that pine adaptations to drought- and fire-prone habitats are linked to the resilience of these forest types. We developed scientific knowledge to assist decision making in adaptive forest management; e.g. fertilizer recommendations or reforestation programmes.@@@Resilience

Branch growth can vary with silvicultural management such as spacing, fertilizing and thinning, and over relatively short periods in response to environmental conditions. Many published regressions based on standard measurements of height and diameter are site, age and treatment specific. The aim of this study was to improve our capacity to predict woody crown dry weight, based on stem measurements, and to minimize (or eliminate) treatment effects on the resulting model. In young trees, branches are temporary support structures for foliage and are often discarded as the base of the green crown rises. As temporary structures they represent an investment of biomass and nutrient elements, and are subject to selection pressures to maximize the return on investment by the tree. Trees were harvested from existing plantation experiments located in south-eastern Queensland for E. grandis W. Hill ex Maiden (ranging from 0.28 to 15.85 m in height, to 5 years old) and south-western Australia for E. globulus Labill. (0.10–34.4 m in height, to 10.2 years) in order to examine the impact of spacing, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization on early growth. Relationships to estimate crown woody biomass from non-destructive measurements were developed, and these relationships tended to have different slopes and intercepts for trees with predominantly juvenile foliage and those with intermediate or adult foliage. Dry weight of whole-crown live branch wood (Wbranch) was related to heights and/or diameter at breast height (DBH), but the regressions parameters were different, depending on treatment. The relationships became more generic (i.e. less dependent on treatment effects) between Wbranch and stem sectional area at the height of the base of the green crown (SACB), consistent with the pipe model theory (R2 > 0.91 for the two species for trees with intermediate/adult leaves). However, Wbranch was more closely related again to the stem volume above the base of the green crown and treatment effects were not significant (VCon,gc, R2 > 0.93). Branches exit the stem below the green crown, and for E. grandis the best relationship was on stem volume above the lowest live branch (VCon,llb, R2 0.94). Limited sampling from four other species with similar or contrasting crown characteristics indicated that the relationship could be applied quite generally. Individual E. grandis branch woody dry weight was closely related to the conical volume of the main (first order) branch (Vcon,br, R2 0.98). The whole crown equivalent, branch woody dry weight plus stem dry weight above the lowest live branch, was also closely related to the stem volume within the woody crown (VCon,llb, R2 0.97–0.99). While the slope of this relationship was still significantly different between trees with juvenile and intermediate/adult foliage, it had a similar form, suggesting that trees with juvenile foliage allocated a different proportion of their woody biomass within the crown to branches than older trees.@@@Eucalyptus grandis

As a result, it differs among and within species due to both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. These phenotypic variations in tree height-diameter allometry determine tree productivity, resistance and resilience to climate variation and, ultimately, the success of plant material used in restoration projects. We tested the effect of climate change and population origin on the phenotypic variation of tree allometry in four pine species at an early stage of development (ca. 11 years old) based upon data originated from multi-site provenance tests and planted along a wide climatic range in south-western Europe. For a representative sample of populations from each species, we used already-developed species-specific height-diameter allometric models to assess changes in allometry between present and future climatic conditions. We found that Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster were the most plastic species, while Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra showed negligible plastic responses. In addition, our models stressed that pine tree height-diameter allometry will change and phenotypic variation could increase, except in P. sylvestris, under future environmental conditions. For some of the species, this might allow the selection of phenotypes better suited to novel climatic conditions. These foreseeable changes in tree height-diameter allometry (among and within-species) could entail eco-evolutionary effects on the early forest plantation dynamics. Therefore, restoration and reforestation plans should consider these effects, as they may interfere with production and/or environmental goals.@@@Climate change

One way to enhance the vigor of plants for outplanting is pre-colonization of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We pursued the strategy that the most promising AM fungus candidates for inoculation would be those associated with the tree of interest in the field. AM fungus communities were assessed in five plantations of Tectona grandis Linn.f. A total of 18 AM fungal morphotypes were found, representing four families: Glomeraceae (49.6%), Acaulosporaceae (24.9%), Claroideoglomeraceae (20.8%), and Gigasporaceae (4.8%). AM fungus spore density was negatively correlated with soil organic carbon. Some of these AM fungi, plus Rhizophagus irregularis, were established in pot culture and in vitro with transformed carrot roots, and subsequently used to inoculate micropropagated plantlets of T. grandis. Tectona grandis plantlets inoculated in vitro were successfully colonized by all AM fungi studied. Plants inoculated with Funneliformis mosseae were taller than uninoculated plants. Tectona grandis plantlets inoculated with the AM fungus Claroideoglomus etunicatum PBT03 were taller than uninoculated controls in ex vitro experiments. This study provides early insight for the targeted use of the AM symbiosis in production of important tree species in future greenhouse studies and reforestation.@@@Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

One hundred and fifty myrtles were selected in three sites with similar environmental characteristics, although with a different length of grazing exclusion: (1) exclosure for 2 years (GE2); (2) exclosure for 3 years (GE3); and (3) long ago grazed plots (GE15): non-accessible to goat for at least 15 years. Fruit production, fruit and seed morphology and seed viability and germination were evaluated. Length of exclosure to goats increased fruit production, mass and volume of the fruits and seed, and endocarp mass. However, seed viability was higher in more recently grazed plots (70–90%) than in GE15 plots (51%). The final balance of viable/germinable seeds produced by an average sized myrtle in each treatment showed that the recently grazed myrtles (GE2) produced nearly five times less seeds (1200) than the myrtles grazed 15 years ago (5500). However, myrtles recovered the ability to produce viable seeds quickly, almost tripling, each year of non-grazing the number of viable/germinable seeds. The results of this study indicated that goat grazing could affect regeneration of myrtle because it reduced reproduction output and the number of viable propagules. Future studies should evaluate other related ecological aspects, such as fruit consumption by potential frugivores and seed dispersal (distance and place of seed deposition).@@@Doñana

Reforestation projects in the rural–urban fringe represent an opportunity for enhancing the environmental quality of peri-urban spaces and a means to contribute to cities carbon neutrality policies. Yet, relatively little information exists regarding the long term (10–25 years) survival and growth rate in urban and peri-urban plantations. This paper reports and discusses the results achieved by a reforestation in the peri-urban space of Rome (Italy), 25 years after its establishment. The plantation has been periodically surveyed between 6 and 24 years of age by means of continuous inventories, with the aim of monitoring growth dynamics. Permanent sample plots have been investigated and stratified by tree species composition (broadleaves vs. conifers, single vs. multispecies) for data analysis. On the whole, plantations show suitable results in terms of rate of growth, carbon storage and uptake, especially in coniferous and mixed stands. The average stand volume of the forest plantation, currently ranges from one-and-a third to one-and-a-half times the average values estimated for natural high forest stands of the same age and species groups at country level. The species groups exhibit differential growth patterns over the observed period, that are mainly due to differences in the ecological traits of the planted trees. Ten years after the establishment, the average annual value of carbon uptake in conifer and mixed species group exceeds 10 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1, a figure corresponding to 4 times the value of deciduous broadleaves (oaks and other species) and 1.5 times the value of evergreen oaks. Twenty years after the establishment, the average annual carbon uptake peaks to 25 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the mixed species group, exceeds 15 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the conifers, and ranks between 6 and 12.5 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the groups dominated by broadleaved species. Overall with a surface area just under 300 ha, the carbon uptake level of the Castel di Guido reforestation allows to offset the 0.04% of CO2 emissions of the city of Rome. Although the spatial coexistence of even-aged plantation blocks characterized by a range of ecological traits, is expected to ensure a more continuous carbon sequestration, being less susceptible to damage of any kind, the current lack of silvicultural management may also lead to degradation processes, by triggering e.g. fuel accumulation and, by consequence, forest fires. In this line, recommendations are provided in order to improve the ecological and functional efficiency of the investigated reforestation. The field experiment demonstrates, ultimately, the capability of the continuous forest inventory to take the pulse over several decades of tree species performance and carbon uptake levels in urban and peri-urban reforestations.@@@Peri-urban reforestation

The Hevea genome predicts a total of 14 TPS genes, and two class I TPS members, HbTPS1 and 2, were explored here for their expressions under various hormone and abiotic stress treatments. HbTPS1 and 2 expressions in latex, cytoplasm of rubber-producing laticifers, were markedly affected by the treatments of ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid, an ethylene releaser), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid although in a distinct manner. HbTPS1 and 2 expressions were significantly up-regulated in a similar manner by cold (5 °C) and heat (40 °C) as examined in Hevea seedling leaves and roots, and by wounding in latex. In comparison, the drought treatment (20% PEG) posed a different effect on HbTPS1 and 2 expressions in Hevea seedlings. For example, in roots, HbTPS1 transcripts accumulated with the treatment, whereas those of HbTPS2 decreased for the first 24 h. Various hormone- and stress-responsive elements could be in silico predicted in HbTPS1 and 2 promoters, and a universal expression was observed for the HbTPS1::GUS activity in all growth stages of transgenic Arabidopsis. These results, coupled with the fact of rubber biosynthesis as a defense response using sucrose as the precursor molecule, propose a potential role of TPS genes in regulating rubber production.@@@Hevea brasiliensis

Understanding the durability of resistance in field settings and the field performance of improved trees is critical for successful species reintroduction. To evaluate methods for reintroducing American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh] to managed forests on the Cumberland Plateau, we quantified four-year survival and growth and three-year competitive ability of chestnut seedlings planted on the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeastern Kentucky, USA. We used a split-plot design to compare chestnut response among three silvicultural treatments spanning a gradient of light levels; midstory removal, thinning, and shelterwood with reserves (2, 24, and 65% available photosynthetically active radiation, respectively) and three chestnut breeding types; American, Chinese (C. mollissima Blume.), and BC2F3 hybrid. One of two hybrid families planted had similar survival to American chestnuts, 21 and 27% survival, respectively, while the other had better survival, 57%. Chinese chestnut survival was better than the other breeding generations (90%). High mortality among American and hybrid chestnut seedlings was likely caused by infection from Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands. Incidence of blight infection was low. While chestnut seedling growth was greatest in the high-light treatment, competitive ability of chestnut, evaluated by comparing planted seedling height to height of understory competitors, was maximized in the intermediate light treatment. These results demonstrate the importance of evaluating competition pressure from co-occurring vegetation and field performance of resistant genotypes when assessing methods for reintroducing tree species to forested settings.@@@Castanea

The top 12 clones in height growth and rust resistance from a screening trial involving 98 hybrid poplar varieties of three taxa (Populus deltoides × P. maximowiczii, DxM; P. deltoides × P. nigra, DxN; P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa, DxT) were selected for planting in replicated yield trials at two locations in the Virginia Piedmont. Results through the first four growing seasons showed that the DxM taxon had the most rapid height development. It was, however, the taxon most affected by a late spring frost at the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest site and by Septoria stem canker at the Reynolds Homestead site. Analysis of variance of clonal and location effects showed highly significant differences among replicates within location and among clones within taxon. Among seven clones within the DxM taxon, pairwise comparison tests of height growth identified two groups: a group of four better clones that were significantly different (p = 0.05) from a second group of three. These early results suggest that multi-selection criteria, including growth, disease and frost resistance, are important when developing hybrid poplar clones for planting in the Piedmont region.@@@Populus

Management practices such as nursery fertilization and field weed control could help early establishment of planted seedlings and reclamation success. We investigated the effect of nursery nutrient loading and field weed control on the growth, nitrogen (N) retranslocation within seedling components, and plant N uptake from the soil for white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seedlings planted on a highly competitive reclaimed oil sands site for two years. Exponential fertilization during nursery production increased the root biomass but not the nutrient reserve in the seedling. In the field experiment, on average across the treatments, 78 and 49% of the total N demand of new tissue growth in the first and second year were met by N retranslocation, respectively. Though exponential fertilization did not affect N retranslocation, it increased the percent height and root collar diameter growth. Weed control increased not only the growth of seedlings by increasing soil N availability, but also N retranslocation within the seedlings in the second year after outplanting. We conclude that vegetation management by weed control is feasible in improving the early growth of white spruce seedlings planted on reclaimed soils and facilitate tree establishment in the oil sands region. Optimization of the nursery exponential N fertilization regime for white spruce may further help with early revegetation of reclaimed oil sands sites.@@@Picea glauca

Indigenous to the central hardwood region, black walnut has been commercially cultivated for many years, and genetic improvement and selections have resulted in superior timber genotypes. The recalcitrance of black walnut cuttings to form adventitious roots is the greatest hurdle for mass propagation of improved material. The goal of this research was to improve the frequency of adventitious root formation in black walnut cuttings, and investigate anatomical changes during root development. Softwood cuttings (15–20 cm) were collected from juvenile and mature sources of elite genotypes, dipped for 60 s in 31.1, 62.2, or 93.2 mM indole-3-butyric acid-potassium salt (K-IBA), or 36.9, 73.8, or 110.7 mM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and then inserted into a moist medium consisting of 3 perlite: 1 coarse vermiculite (v/v). Cuttings were placed in bench-top fog chambers or a mist bench for 5 weeks. To visualize anatomical changes during root formation, stems were fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned, and stained on sequential days throughout root development. Rooting was greatest (72%) for cuttings exposed to 93.2 mM K-IBA and placed in the fog chamber, while cuttings treated with IBA rooted at lower frequencies (16–22.2%). Cuttings in the mist bench often deteriorated and rooted at lower frequencies independent of the auxin type. Anatomical analysis revealed adventitious root initials by day 16 and root primordia formation by day 18. Rooted cuttings survived acclimatization to the greenhouse.@@@Adventitious roots

Despite recent increases in wildfire activity in this region, fire ecology of European larch is poorly understood compared to other larch species around the world. This study aims to assess whether European larch forests are resilient to fires, and to find out the factors that drive such resilience. We assessed the recovery of larch forests along a gradient of fire severity (low, moderate, high) based on the abundance and dominance of post-fire larch regeneration. We established 200 plots distributed among burned larch forests in nine wildfires that occurred between 1973 and 2007 in the western Alps. We included variables regarding topography, climate, fire severity, fire legacies, ground cover, grazing intensity, and time since fire. To evaluate potential drivers of larch recruitment, we applied generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and random forests (RF). Larch regeneration was much more abundant and dominant in the moderate- and high-severity fire classes than in the low-severity class. More than half of the plots in the moderate- and high-severity classes were classified as resilient, i.e., post-fire larch regeneration was enough to recover a larch stand. GLMM and RF produced complementary results: fire severity and legacies, such as snags, canopy cover and distance to seed source, were crucial factors explaining post-fire larch recruitment. This study shows that fire has a positive effect on larch regeneration, and we conclude that European larch forests are highly resilient to mixed-severity fires in the western Alps.@@@Fire severity

Natural diachronic succession was evaluated on three large plots or sites, differing in their land use and vegetation composition, one is dominated by grass species on an abandoned pasture (Pasture site), the other two are post-fire vegetation dominated by bracken (Bracken site) and various shrubs (Shrub site). Additionally, we assessed the effectiveness of manual removal of competitive herbaceous species to accelerate forest recovery. Monitoring was done in 2003, 2005 and 2007 on 48 subplots of 116 m2 each recording species richness and woody-species density. Results showed that the Pasture site demonstrated a competitive effect of exotic grasses on woody species recruitment with much lower species recruitment and density, suggesting serious inhibition of natural forest regeneration and an unclear successional trajectory. The Bracken and Shrub sites became significantly similar floristically and there is evidence for a marked facilitation of woody plant recruitment correlated with light availability on the ground. Both sites showed characteristics of classic succession, with Shrub showing a higher species richness and density while late-successional species are poorly represented on the Bracken site. However, NMDS ordination using species density showed that the two trajectories may not be converging towards a common “final state”. Manual weeding was ineffective for accelerating forest recovery. These results suggest that the main limiting factor for the recruitment of woody species on the Pasture site is strong grass competition and must be addressed before seed availability, while seed availability seems to be the constraining factor for Bracken and Shrub site development, thus direct seeding or planting may be effective in accelerating forest recovery.@@@Andes region

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as rapid and non-destructive method for authentication of Picea abies L. Karst seed provenances. For this purpose, five seed lots from Sweden, Finland, Poland and Lithuania each were used. NIR reflectance spectra were recorded on individual seeds (n = 150 seeds × 5 seed lots × 4 provenances = 3000 seeds) using XDS Rapid Content Analyzer from 780 to 2500 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm. Classification model was developed by orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis. The performance of the computed classification model was validated using two test sets—internal (the same seed lots as the model but excluded during model development; n = 600 seeds) and external (seed lots not included in the model; n = 1158 seeds). For the internal test, the model correctly recognized 99% of Swedish, Finnish and Polish samples and 97% of Lithuanian seeds. For the external test samples, the model correctly assigned 81% of Swedish, 96% of Finnish, 98% of Lithuanian and 93% of Polish seeds to their respective classes. The mean classification accuracy was 99 and 95% for internal and external test set, respectively. The spectral differences among seed lots were attributed to differences in chemical composition of seeds, presumably fatty acids and proteins, which are the dominant storage reserves in P. abies seeds. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy is a very promising method for monitoring putative seed provenances and in seed certification.@@@NIRS

We examined the changes in plant biomass C and soil organic C (SOC) storage across a chronosequence of E. urophylla × E. grandis forests (4-, 7-, 10-, 13-, and 21-year-old) in subtropical China. Biomass C stock significantly increased with stand age. SOC storage increased initially after afforestation, peaking in 10-year-old stands, and declined gradually. Ecosystem C pools in the five development stages were 111.76, 167.66, 234.04, 281.00, and 299.29 Mg ha−1, respectively. Trees and soils were the dominant C pools across all stand ages with the contribution of tree biomass C storage significantly increasing and SOC storage decreasing with age. Eucalyptus plantations are still in vigorous growth phase and have great potential for C sequestration at the end of the current rotation length (within 7 years). Considering the sharp decrease of annual biomass C increment rate and the gradual loss of SOC storage in stands older than 13 years, we recommend the optimal length for one full Eucalyptus plantation cycle should be 12–15 years in subtropical China to maximize land-use value and carbon sink value.@@@Eucalyptus hybrid

However, few studies have focused on the seasonal dynamics of fine roots with different branching orders. The objective of this study is to provide insight to the seasonal heterogeneity in roots of different orders within root hierarchies of poplar trees under different soil conditions. Three plots were established in high (plantation A) and low (plantation B) soil nutrient conditions. Fine roots were sampled in each of four seasons throughout one year. All sampled roots were classified into one to five groups depending on their branching order, and the dry biomass of living roots and the concentrations of C, nitrogen (N) and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) were examined. Low order (first- to second-order) roots demonstrated more significant seasonal dynamics than high order roots, and the biomass of first-order fine roots was positively influenced by soil temperature and moisture while the biomass of second-order fine roots was negatively affected by soil nutrient conditions. The different responses of fine roots to environmental fluctuations implied a high division of root function, even within low order roots. The C and N chemistry of poplar fine roots also differed significantly with branching order; element concentrations were lower in low order roots. Principal component analysis indicated that root order explained 98.2% of the variation in fine root chemistry. Moreover, the first-order roots in plantation A had greater C but less TNC concentrations than those in plantation B, suggesting that C allocation in low order roots may be more responsive to soil nutrient conditions. The allocation of C and N also exhibited significant seasonal dynamics (p < 0.05); the TNC concentration was highest in winter, whereas C:N ratios were significantly lower in the summer and fall in each order of fine roots (p < 0.05). All these results suggest that branching order may be related to root growth and photoassimilate allocation, which should receive greater attention in future studies on C and N fluxes in forest ecosystems.@@@Seasonal dynamics

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire—15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.@@@Natural regeneration

Uncertainties about the consequences of such approaches prompted us to examine the combined impacts of aggregated overstory retention and harvest residue retention on the composition and density of regeneration following biomass harvests on four operational-scale (40 ha) study areas dominated by Populus tremuloides Michx. in northern Minnesota. Whole-tree harvest had no statistically significant effects on initial (2-year) regeneration densities, including root suckers, sprouts, and seedlings relative to conventional, stem-only harvest. The density of shrub stems was also unaffected by harvest residue retention. Despite having a lower mean leaf area index than intact forest controls, aggregates maintained comparable densities of the four most common tree species, individually, as well as all tree species combined. The composition of regeneration within aggregates differed from surrounding harvested areas as expected, but this increase in complexity at the stand scale was achieved without diminishing P. tremuloides densities in the edge area (0–5 m) surrounding aggregates 2 years after harvest. These initial findings suggest even small aggregates of overstory reserves may achieve basic objectives related to structural complexity and sustaining shade-tolerant tree species in harvested units without compromising regeneration objectives for less tolerant species.@@@Populus tremuloides

Climate change can modify these gradients and, at the lower limit of species distributions, individuals may become stressed and their general health and reproductive performance may decrease. Study and prediction of the effects of climate change on the distribution of species along these gradients is therefore necessary. Our model study species, Pinus pseudostrobus, is a widely distributed pine in Mexico, ranging from 1600 to 3200 masl in altitude. In order to explore changes in health condition and reproductive investment along an altitudinal gradient, ten reproductive trees were selected in each of four populations (at 2300, 2400, 2700 and 2900 masl). As a proxy of individual health, we conducted a rapid visual assessment for each tree, based on crown defoliation, dead branches and foliage discoloration. This stress condition index (SCI) ranges from zero to fifteen, and lower values indicate low stress and therefore better health conditions. We also evaluated reproductive (cone weight, number/weight of seeds) and progeny (germination/seedling growth) traits. In addition, the relationships between SCI and the reproductive/progeny traits were assessed. The lowest altitude population presented poor health, with higher values of SCI (mean ± SE = 6.3 ± 0.9) that reduced up to 4.8-fold in higher-altitude populations. Cone weight also differed among altitudes, with lighter cones in the lower population (mean ± SE = 38.2 ± 4.3 g), and 1.5-fold heavier cones found in the higher populations. In general, all of the reproductive/progeny traits differed among altitudes. The population of intermediate altitude (2700 masl) presented the highest values for all traits evaluated, indicating higher performance at this altitude. Finally, a negative relationship was found between stress condition and cone weight. Based on our results and climate change models and their predictions, an increase in physiological stress can be expected in individuals of low altitude populations. Furthermore, possible increases in pests and pathogens are likely to contribute to the decline of this population. It is therefore necessary to maintain efforts of stress condition assessment and population dynamics, as well as to permanently monitor the climate along altitudinal gradients.@@@Stress condition index

Due to its strong reliance on ectomycorrhizae and low survival rate from damping-off during seedling cultivation and in nurseries, we explored the early influence of three ectomycorrhizal fungi (Handkea utriformis, Suillus lactifluus, and Suillus tomentosus) on the growth, root morphological characters, root vitality, and survival of P. tabulaeformis seedlings from subsequent damping-off in a pot experiment. In addition, the in vitro suppression of three ectomycorrhizal fungi on the damping-off pathogen (Fusarium solani) was evaluated and observed using a scanning electron microscope. We found that all three ectomycorrhizal fungi could colonize more than 40% of the roots of P. tabulaeformis, promote plant shoot and root growth, increase the proportion of large-diameter roots, improve root vitality, and increase survival rates 3 months after inoculation. All three ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed the growth of F. solani to a different extent in vitro. Ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae proliferated and wrapped around the hyphae of F. solani when the hyphae encountered each other. The colonization rate of P. tabulaeformis roots was highly correlated with root vitality and root growth parameters, while the survival rate of P. tabulaeformis seedlings was highly correlated with the colonization rate of P. tabulaeformis roots, root vitality and growth. Our results suggest that early contact between P. tabulaeformis and ectomycorrhizal fungi could improve plant growth and resistance against damping-off.@@@Ectomycorrhizal fungi

This study aimed to unravel how soil aggregates and soil carbon (C) stock stability of a P. tabulaeformis plantation change after 60 years of natural development and was performed in Vitex negundo var. heterophylla and Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa shrub (shrub), a P. tabulaeformis forest (pine), and a coniferous broadleaf P. tabulaeformis mixed forest (pine-oak). Afforestation increased the stability of soil aggregates in the 0–10 cm soil layer but resulted in a decrease in the 10–20 cm soil layer. However, the presence of deciduous broadleaf species in the pine plantation improved the stability of soil aggregates. The total soil C stock was increased by afforestation, especially in the pine-oak forest, where it reached a significant level. The mineral soil C stock in the shrub stand was higher than that in pine and lower than that in pine-oak forests, but the C fractions had a different change. Afforestation increased the C fraction of macroaggregates in the 0–10 cm soil layer but decreased it in the 10–20 cm soil layer. This result suggested that afforestation could improve soil C stabilization in deeper soil. However, the pine-oak forest had a higher C fraction of macroaggregates than the pine forest in the 10–20 cm soil layer, indicating that soil C stabilization of the P. tabulaeformis plantation decreased when deciduous broadleaf species were present and thus formed the coniferous broadleaf mixed forest.@@@Pinus tabulaeformis plantation

The objective of this study was to identify and quantify the limitations induced by soil and climate, and compare the magnitude of their effects, on annual aboveground yields across ten SRCs of Salix miyabeana SX67 in Quebec, Canada. The effects of weather variation between years on yields were also tested within locations. In five plots per SRC, soil bulk density, particle size, exchangeable cations and bulk composition were analysed, and moisture deficits were estimated using leaf δ13C. For each location, numerous weather variables were simulated for spring, summer and the whole growing season. Climate was calculated by averaging weather variables for growing seasons for which annual yields were available. Annual aboveground biomass yields were modelled using linear regression, partitioning of the variance and mixed models with soil, weather and climate variables as predictors. Across SRCs, silt content, soil organic matter, pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg, and total N and Zn were significantly and positively related to aboveground yields (adj. R 2 ranging from 0.38 to 0.79). Generally, annual yields were negatively related to summer temperature within SRCs (adj. R 2 = 0.92) and drought across SRCs (adj. R 2 = 0.54). Partitioning of the variance revealed that soil variables (~80%) had a greater effect on productivity than did climate variables (~10%). In fact, soil properties buffered or exacerbated water shortages and, thus, had a preponderant effect on yield.@@@Soil nutrients

"944","Alternative approaches to mixed conifer forest restoration: partitioning the competitive neighborhood@@@@@@Received: 21 March 2017 Accepted: 19 June 2017 Published: 22 June 2017 Issue Date: November 2017@@@Forest restoration efforts in the intermountain west of North America generally seek to promote the continuation of pine dominance, enhance wildlife habitat, and decrease hazardous fuels, thereby mitigating catastrophic losses from various stressors and disturbances. We propose a method of focal tree release thinning that partitions the competitive neighborhood to provide alternative approaches to managers. Specifically, we sought to examine how competition index (CI) derived harvest simulations alter forest structure, composition, and variability, and evaluate the ecological implications and efficacy of achieving management recommendations. We used a tree inventory collected across 38 experimental plots in the mixed conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada and simulated post-harvest structure using common silvicultural prescriptions to the ownership and cover type. We calculated competition values for all trees using 10 CIs and simulated harvests from two defined integrals of each corresponding probability density function to compare with the standard marking scenario, for a total of 21 harvest simulations. We assessed post-harvest structure through tree density and diameter distributions, basal area by species, and a structural diversity index. Post-harvest conditions exhibited differences in levels of structural diversity and species dominance; however we did not detect any influence on tree density across diameter classes. Most simulations resulted in a decline of non-pine species basal area relative to the default, while only 3 thinning scenarios showed concomitant increases in pine. Every simulation resulted in greater variance of structural diversity than the default marking guidelines. Review of this method highlighted the variability in tree ranked competitive status across indices. We emphasize that no harvest simulation by CI was clearly superior in all aspects of achieving desired objectives, and there was no clear benefit to incorporating inter-tree distances to calculate CI. We consistently observed favorable outcomes in harvest simulations derived from an open-grown crown width parameter which averts the need for tree distance measurements. This approach can be tailored across multiple individual plots, each maintaining unique competitive environments that reflect local tree neighborhoods.@@@Competition

In the present study, nine elite accessions of J. curcas from tropical dry forests in Ecuador were cultivated for the purpose of evaluating seed production in relation to the propagation method used (seed, cutting). A split-plot design with three replicates was applied. Seed production, measured over a period of 7 years (2009–2015) showed a large year-to-year variation. However, seed production varied significantly among accessions and depended on the propagation method (seeds or cuttings). Propagation by stem cuttings stabilized the variability in the vegetative and seed production components measured, increasing the strength of their relationships with seed yield. The three highest yielding accessions produced 0.28–0.30 kg of seeds tree−1 year−1. As seed yield was not correlated with annual precipitation, the year-to-year variation in production of accessions indicates the effect of other factors not considered here, such as agronomic practices. The study findings suggest that agroforestry practices could be developed that would enable J. curcas to play a predominant role in a strategy for tropical dry forests aimed at reducing poverty (also known as pro-poor growth strategy).@@@Germplasm bank

To date, most studies aim at understanding of post-stress physiological and anatomical adaptation to drought stress; however only few studies focus on plant recovery. In the present study, transpiration, shoot water potential, and anatomical and morphological measurements were performed on 4-year-old European beech seedlings with fully developed leaves. The seedlings were exposed to three levels of soil water potential (well-watered, moderate drought stress and severe drought stress) and followed by rewatering under greenhouse conditions. Reduced transpiration rates were observed in the stressed seedlings as a response to drought stress, whereas anatomical and morphological variables remained unchanged. Three days after rewatering, transpiration rates in both moderately and severely stressed seedlings recovered to the levels of those of well-watered seedlings. Drought stress promoted leaf budding, resulting in higher shoot dry mass of stressed seedlings. Our findings indicate that anatomical and morphological adaptations of European beech seedlings to drought stress are visibly limited during late-season growth stages. These results will help us to further understand factors involved in drought adaptation potential of European beech seedlings faced with expected climate-related environmental changes. To complete our findings, further experiments on plant recovery from drought stress should be focused on different periods of growing season.@@@Anatomy

Mortality is associated with water stress, but underlying physiological mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the physiological performance of declining trees during the summer drought. Leaf water potential, gas-exchange, fluorescence of photosystem II and leaf and root starch concentration were compared in healthy (asymptomatic) and declining trees. Low annual cork increment in declining trees indicated tree decline for several years. All trees showed similar water status in spring. In summer, declining trees showed lower predawn leaf water potential (−2.0 vs. −0.8 MPa), but unexpectedly higher midday leaf water potential than healthy trees (−2.8 vs. −3.3 MPa). The higher midday water potential was linked to by means of strongly reduced stomatal conductance and, consequently, transpiration. This study is pioneer showing that declining trees had high midday water potential. A tendency for lower sap flow driving force (the difference between predawn and midday water potential) in declining trees was also associated with reduced photosynthesis, suggesting that chronic dieback may be associated with low carbon uptake. However, starch in roots and leaves was very low and not correlated to the health status of trees. Declining trees showed lower water-use efficiency and non-photochemical quenching in summer, indicating less resistance to drought. Contrarily to chronic decline, one tree that underwent sudden death presented predawn leaf water potential below the cavitation threshold.@@@Quercus suber

African teak) is one of the most valuable timber species in Central Africa. Like other shade intolerant tropical tree species, P. elata could play a vital role in economic development, and ecological sustainability, but regenerates poorly following selective logging. Now endangered, there is a critical need for sustainable silvicultural systems to restore this once prominent timber species. To assess management options for P. elata we analyzed growth performance and survival in primary and secondary forest plots under burning and weeding treatments in Yoko Forest Reserve, Ubundu Democratic Republic of Congo. We transplanted nursery-grown seedlings of P. elata to experimental gaps and followed their growth and survival for 1 year. Seedlings in large canopy gaps 50 × 50 m were taller (mean difference; P = 0.006) and more likely to survive (mean difference; P < 0.001). Weeding improved both diameter (P = 0.024) and height (P = 0.007) growth rates; however, burning alone did not significantly improve the performance of P. elata seedlings. Our data suggest that P. elata regeneration is compatible with shelterwood harvesting and traditional swidden agricultural systems widely practiced in the region.@@@Pericopsis elata

The protocol used for classification of seed desiccation tolerance and storage is time consuming and many times limited by the lack of information about optimum conditions for seed germination and treatments to overcome seed dormancy. This study evaluated 66 Brazilian tree species aiming to correlate seed characteristics with desiccation tolerance. For this purpose, a model was established to explain the relationship of tegument/seed mass ratio (SCR), seed mass, and water content of embryo + endosperm with desiccation tolerance. The principal component analysis showed the establishment of two groups, indicating the interaction between desiccation tolerance and seed characteristics. Recalcitrant seeds are more often associated with the water content of embryo + endosperm and water content of tegument + endocarp, while orthodox seeds are more associated with SCR and number of seeds per kilogram. The classification found using the model proposed was significantly correlated with desiccation tolerance and storage, with 92% confidence for the analyzed species. Seeds morphological characteristics can be used for prediction of desiccation tolerance and storage behavior; however, the use of a model that combines more variables increases the chance of accurate classification.@@@Seed storage behavior

A model was developed for use in determining the profitability of a tree-breeding program (TBP) with pine hybrids in commercial plantations. Growth measurement data were collected in four, 12-year-old genetic trials on Mondi and Sappi land holdings in South Africa. Growth models developed for P. patula and P. taeda in South Africa were used to infer models for the other taxa and to calculate the optimal financial rotation age at discount rates of 6 and 8%. Financial data on pine plantations were collected from different sources in South Africa. Optimal rotation lengths in this study were found to be between 12 and 16 years for pulpwood and 17 years for sawtimber. The model output shows the net present value (NPV), the internal rate of return, and the minimum area that a tree grower has to plant every year in order to justify the investment in a TBP. A stochastic approach with Monte Carlo simulation showed that the sensitivity of NPV to uncertainty in the wood price was greater than that for the planting, harvesting, and transport costs.@@@Pine hybrids

Three different restoration treatments including natural regeneration (NR), artificial regeneration (AR), and artificial promotion (AP), were adopted in the Greater Hinggan Mountain area of China after a serious fire occurred on May 6, 1987. NR is a control treatment where recovery occurs naturally without intervention, AR comprises salvage logging followed by planting, while AP includes regeneration by removing dead trees, weeding, and tidying to promote seed germination. In this study, the objective was to detect and compare the effects of the three restoration treatments using radar indices derived from ALOS/PALSAR data. Four time-series SAR images were pre-processed to acquire the backscattering coefficients. Then the coefficients in both HH and HV polarization were examined and two radar vegetation indices were derived and evaluated, based on which, the post-fire forest dynamics under different restoration treatments were detected and compared. The results showed that the forests under NR presented a completely different recovery trajectory compared to those under the other two treatments. This difference could be characterized by both the backscattering intensity in HH and HV polarization and two radar indices. This study indicated the effects of different restoration treatments, as well as demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of radar remote sensing techniques in forest monitoring and management.@@@Post-fire restoration

Acacia mangium has been the key species underpinning the pulp and paper industries in Sumatra, however increased disease pressure on A. mangium is expected to require large-scale conversion of Acacia plantations to Eucalyptus in the near future. The effect of such a large scale change in plantation species on soil moisture, for both tree production, and catchment hydrology is unknown. In this study we sought to characterize the impacts of plantation species (Acacia or Eucalyptus) and nitrogen management, on soil moisture, soil water depletion and depth to groundwater under stands of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus pellita over the first 2–3 years after establishment. The study was conducted in experiments at four sites in Sumatra, Indonesia. Soil moisture and soil water depletion were not influenced by plantation species or fertilizer treatment. Soil moisture content and soil water depletion were strongly influenced by shallow groundwater at two of the four sites, however depth to groundwater did not influence stem growth. Results from the field trials cautiously suggest that large scale conversion of Acacia mangium to Eucalypt species in these regions is unlikely to result in increased moisture stress, nor is conversion of plantation species likely to lead to substantial differences in catchment hydrology. This study demonstrated the importance of conducting multi-site studies when investigating biophysical relationships in forest/plantation systems.@@@Ground water

Thus, nurseries need to produce seedlings with plant attributes that favor the best chance of successful establishment once they are field planted. From the mid-twentieth century on, research foresters have critically examined plant attributes that confer improved seedling growth under various restoration site conditions. This review examines the value of commonly measured seedling quality attributes (i.e., height, diameter, root mass, shoot-to-root ratio, drought resistance, freezing tolerance, nutrient status, root growth potential, and root electrolyte leakage) that have been recognized as important in explaining why seedlings with improved attributes have better growth after planting. Seedlings with plant attributes that fall within the appropriate range of values can increase the speed with which they overcome planting stress, initiate growth, and become “coupled” to the forest restoration site, thereby ensuring successful seedling establishment. Although planting high quality seedlings does not guarantee successful seedling establishment, it increases chances for successful establishment and growth.@@@Forest restoration

Recent studies have reported an increasing dominance of American beech in the understory and midstory of these forests. Beech is a commercially less desirable tree species due to its association with beech-bark disease, and because it commonly interferes with the regeneration of other more desirable tree species. We examined hardwood regeneration characteristics nine years after application of a 3 × 4 factorial combination of glyphosate herbicide (0.56, 1.12, and 1.68 kg ha−1) and surfactant concentrations (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0% v v−1) to release sugar maple regeneration from beech-dominated understories using three stands that received shelterwood seed cutting in central Maine. Measurements nine years after treatment showed that glyphosate rate increased both absolute (AD) and relative density (RD) of sugar maple regeneration, but not its height (HT). In contrast, beech AD, RD, and HT were all significantly reduced with increasing glyphosate rate. Post-release browsing by ungulates and a high residual overstory basal area resulted in reduced sugar maple HT. Our results indicated that glyphosate herbicide applied in stands that have been recently shelterwood seed cut can significantly increase the abundance of sugar maple regeneration. However, subsequent browsing damage combined with the negative influence of the residual overstory cover can limit the longer-term benefit of understory herbicide treatments. Subsequent removal of the overstory and browsing-control measures may be needed to promote sugar maple regeneration over beech in similar northern hardwood stands.@@@Northern hardwoods of USA

However, this phenomenon is poorly understood in tropical dryland tree species. In the present study, we investigated how Acacia senegal reproduces in two different environmental contexts in Kenya. Open-pollinated progeny arrays of 10 maternal trees from each environmental context were genotyped using 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. Overall, A. senegal displayed a predominantly allogamous mating pattern. However, higher multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) was found in Lake Bogoria (tm = 1.00) than in Kampi ya Moto population (tm = 0.949). Higher biparental inbreeding (t m − t s = 0.116) and correlation of outcrossed paternity (rp = 0.329) was found in Kampi ya Moto than in Lake Bogoria population (t m − t s = 0.074, rp = 0.055), showing the occurrence of mating among relatives. Coefficient of coancestry (Θ = 0.208) showed that full-sibs constitute about 21% of the offspring in Kampi ya Moto population compared to about 14% (Θ = 0.136) in Lake Bogoria population. The results demonstrate that low adult tree density of A. senegal may be promoting seed production through consanguineous mating and suggest that man-made disturbance can affect mating patterns of the species. Despite these mating differences, trees from both populations can contribute as seed source for conservational plans, and to support effective genetic conservation and artificial regeneration programs of A. senegal. We suggest collection of seeds from at least 42 and 63 trees in Lake Bogoria and Kampi ya Moto populations, respectively, to retain a progeny array with a total effective population size of 150.@@@Anthropogenic disturbance

This information is needed to make realistic projections about carbon sequestration of different species in different environments. Farmers manage natural regeneration of many native species in the drylands of Niger, so there is interest in carbon sequestration potential of the species. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) if tree height, stem diameter, mean ring width, wood density and carbon concentration differ among five tree and shrub species (Combretum glutinosum, Combretum micranthum, Combretum nigricans, Guiera senegalensis, Piliostigma reticulatum) in Niger; (2) if variation within species is affected by land use type (parkland agroforests, woodlands), soil type (sandy, rocky), terrain type (temporarily flooded, flat, hill slope) and mean annual rainfall; and (3) if growth variables, wood density and carbon concentration are correlated in the five species. Environmental variables did not have strong effects on growth and wood variables of the species, and some effects differed among species. Height across species increased with mean annual rainfall. Stem diameter and mean ring width across species were greater in parkland agroforests than in woodlands. Carbon concentration was positively correlated with growth variables of four species, but was not correlated with wood density in most species. Correlations between wood density and growth differed in sign among some species. We conclude that above-ground carbon sequestration per tree probably increases with mean annual rainfall and is greater in parkland agroforests than in woodlands.@@@Carbon sequestration

We planted seedlings of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) in strip openings of 3, 6 and 9 m width to control light. Individual mesh sleeves were used to reduce browsing pressure but they also reduced available light for seedlings: a large mesh and a small mesh sleeves were tested in each opening. Available light for seedlings ranged from 5 to 46% of full sunlight. First year growth was almost non-responsive to all treatments for both species, but birch showed strong responses during second year. Birches in the large mesh sleeve and the 9 m opening had the largest height and diameter increments, while those in the small mesh sleeve and the 3 m opening had the smallest increments. Small mesh sleeves increased the height over stem diameter ratio for both species. Treatments affected several other morphometric variables of birch but none of the oak. More time is needed to assert if bur oak can be a candidate species for enrichment planting. We recommend strip openings of 9 m width and large mesh sleeves, for protection against deer browsing, while controlling neighbouring competition, to promote artificial regeneration of hardwood species.@@@Enrichment planting

B.S.P.] in order to obtain reliable estimates for supporting eastern Canadian tree breeding strategies. The study was based on data collected from two series of progeny tests of black spruce in New Brunswick (NB) including 285 open-pollinated families and more than 57,000 individual trees. Height (HT), diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem forking (SF) were periodically measured between ages 5 and 35 years. Results showed that tree volume (V), HT and DBH were highly genetically controlled, with average individual narrow-sense heritability (\(h_{i}^{2}\)) estimates of 0.29, 0.29 and 0.21, and family mean heritability (\(h_{F}^{2}\)) estimates of 0.82, 0.85 and 0.77, respectively. SF had low \(h_{i}^{2}\) (= 0.06 on average) but had moderate \(h_{F}^{2}\) (= 0.56), indicating family selection might effectively reduce SF. Both \(h_{i}^{2}\) and \(h_{F}^{2}\) increased with age and then stabilized or declined, being the highest around ages 15–20 years for all traits. The type-B genetic correlation (\(r_{B}\)) estimates were moderate to high for all the traits, suggesting negligible genotype × environment interactions. Strong age–age genetic correlation estimates were found for growth traits, implying the potential for practicing early selection. Age–age genetic correlation estimates were moderate for SF (= 0.72). Trait–trait genetic correlation estimates were strong and positive among growth traits, but between growth traits and SF they were mostly negligible albeit positive. Overall, results suggest that genetic selection will be effective for growth traits but much less so for reducing stem forking in New Brunswick’s black spruce.@@@Heritability

One such tree with promise is dinde [Maclura tinctoria (L.) D. Don ex Steud]; a multi-purpose, Neotropical tree species that is being widely introduced on to farms of the coffee axis region in the Latin American Andes. No formal studies have been made that examine its potential for reforestation. In this study we aim to measure and define the relationships between age, bole size (dbh), tree height, and crown size of planted dinde trees for the development of spacing guidelines at time of planting and for thinning. We also sought to identify whether tree growth is influenced by various measures of soil fertility. We studied these relationships on dinde trees planted at twelve farms in the central Andean foothills of Colombia. Our results are the first to show dinde has comparable growth to other native and exotic trees used for reforestation in Latin America. Strong relationships exist for tree age and diameter at breast height (DBH) with crown size and height. Based on these relationships we developed spacing and thinning guidelines for timber production in plantation and silvo-pastoral circumstances. Soils were generally fertile but varied between farms. Growth varied with soil primarily related to pH and calcium, and secondly to soil nitrogen and organic matter. Our results provide preliminary information for the forester and/or the farmer on expected growth and size relationships for given ages in relation to soil fertility for planted trees. As more trees are planted on a wider array of soils and providing a greater diversity of ages further studies are necessary for refining guidelines.@@@Agroforestry

Karst.) is a relatively common practice in Norway on medium to low site indices. However, seedling establishment is often hampered by rapid regrowth of competing vegetation in scarified patches. The aim of our study was to examine the effect of coordinating scarification towards an expected seed-fall, by studying germination and seedling establishment in scarified patches of different age (fresh, one- and two-year-old). The experiment was conducted in two stands in southeast Norway that were clear-cut in 2007. Scarification was applied to subplots in autumn 2008–2010. To simulate seed-fall, seeds were sown in fresh scarification patches in spring 2009–2011, in one-year-old patches in 2010 and 2011, and in two-year-old patches in 2011. Both germination and seedling survival were negatively affected by the age of the scarified patches. Germination was higher, and mortality lower, at the small fern woodland site, compared with the bilberry woodland site. Sowing in fresh patches also resulted in increased height and root collar diameter of the seedlings compared with sowing in older patches. It is likely that the competing vegetation both on the site and in the scarification patches affected the growth of the seedlings. In conclusion, the age of the scarified patches affected both germination and mortality, as well as early growth of the seedlings.@@@Competing vegetation

After disturbance, clonal aspen stands quickly achieve canopy closure by sending up numerous clonal shoots (root suckers) from their lateral root system. Controlled aboveground disturbance will commonly induce prolific root suckering and thereby increase stem density in clonal aspen stands, but it is unclear if increases in stem density will be observed in planted seedling-origin aspen stands. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) overall root suckering response of planted aspen to aboveground disturbance; (2) if different cut heights of the stem or infliction of root damage impact the number of root suckers produced. We found that planted aspen regenerated readily after disturbance, averaging five root suckers per cut tree. However, individual response was highly variable, ranging from zero to 29 root suckers per root system. Of the cut trees, 75% produced at least one root sucker and 60% produced at least one stump sprout. Cutting trees close to the soil surface produced more root suckers than leaving a 25 cm stump. While root system size (mass and length) was well correlated with aboveground measures of planted aspen, root suckering was not related to root system size. As a result of increased forest reclamation efforts in the boreal forest region the planting of aspen has become a more common practice, necessitating a better understanding of the regeneration dynamics and root suckering potential of these planted and seedling-origin aspen forests.@@@Planted aspen seedlings

In the present study, strategic N uptake of nitrate and ammonium by 30 dominant species were investigated over two post-agricultural succession sequences in a calcareous karst area, southeast China. Each sequence includes grassland, shrubland, secondary forest and primary forest. Proportional contribution of nitrate and ammonium to plant N was estimated using isotopic mixing calculation. N uptake preference for the two N forms was assessed by comparing assimilation and availability of the N forms. The proportional contribution to plant N was much greater for nitrate than ammonium for the investigated species except three species (Monochoria vaginalis, Boehmeria dolichostachya and Miscanthus floridulus) for which the difference was not significant. Correlation analysis revealed that the contribution to plant N by a particular N form was linearly and positively related to its concentrations in soil. The proportional contribution to plant N by nitrate and ammonium increased logarithmically and decreased exponentially, respectively, as soil nitrate to ammonium ratio increased. N form uptake preference varied according to communities, but was consistent for the coexisting species within each community. The results indicate that the coexisting species share a similar strategy in their uptake of nitrate and ammonium during post-agricultural succession in the calcareous karst region, southwest China.@@@Coexisting plant species

Understanding the mechanisms of drought tolerance in Eucalyptus is essential for the successful production in drought-regions. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate how water availability preceding a long-term drought period affects morphological, physiological and molecular traits of four Eucalyptus clones grown under field conditions. The study areas are located in north-eastern Brazil with an average rainfall of 800 and 1500 mm per year. At each rainfall regime, the following clones were evaluated: 1404 (Eucalyptus urophylla), 1407 (E. urophylla × E. camaldulensis), 1296 and 6500 (E. grandis × E. urophylla). Our results indicate that trees growing in the area with higher annual precipitation were more stressed after long-term drought, compared to those stands previously exposed to mild water-restriction period. The genetic materials showed distinct responses to drought, which allowed their separation in two groups: drought-tolerant (1404 and 1407) and drought sensitive (6500 and 1296). The former group shows some important adaptations to drought, such as decreased leaf area (avoiding excessive transpiration rates), higher antioxidant activity and carotenoid concentration (leading to lower lipid peroxidation). In conclusion, previous exposure to water deficit may provide the benefit of increased defense protection during future water deficit. From all measured variables, the leaf area, antioxidant compounds and changes in 13C and 18O isotope abundance reflect some of the most important morphological and physiological alterations in order to mitigate the water stress damage in drought-tolerant genotypes.@@@Eucalyptus

Such studies are relevant for the Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) because of the high value of its seeds and wood. To reveal growth and reproductive variations among Siberian stone pine ecotypes in relation to the climate of the provenances, we examined their growth height, crown diameter, stem volume, number of female cones, and male shoots, at different ages, in the clonal common garden experiment established in 1996 in Russia. Scions were obtained from 11 to 19 randomly selected 100–170-year old trees in each of four natural stands located on the latitudinal transect on the West Siberian plain. They were grafted onto local 4 year old Siberian stone pine seedlings and grown in a common garden experiment comprising nine plots near the southern margin of the species’ natural range. Growth traits were affected by climatic conditions in the provenances: generally, a warmer climate was associated with more rapid growth. Variation among the ecotypes at the graft age of 12 years was not large; however, it significantly increased by the age of 19. The relationship was ambiguous between reproductive traits and the climate of the provenances. The proportion of female, male and bisexual clones varied among years in all ecotypes. Most of the clones had only female cones; male clones were less common. The southern ecotype showed rapid growth and formed the lowest number of male shoots and female cones. The northern ecotype showed the weakest growth and moderate cone bearing, along with abundant male flowering. The intermediate ecotypes had a moderate growth and the highest numbers of cones, along with moderate numbers of male shoots. These results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the patterns and nature of variation in growth and reproductive traits.@@@Siberian stone pine

We elucidated major factors influencing local variation of TAGB within an anthropogenically modified hillside forest in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. On forty 400 m2 sized plots all tree species were recorded, and their biomass was calculated using allometric equations. In addition, bio-physical parameters relating to terrain and soils were measured. Effects of bio-physical variables on forest TAGB were assessed using multivariate regression methods. Forest TAGB (average 117 Mg ha−1) was primarily explained by forest structural variables, i.e. tree densities and average heights, in particular presence of large trees. TAGB was largely determined by the biomass of a few species which dominated different forest parts (ridges or hill base); TAGB was hardly influenced by species diversity. Many dominant trees were light-demanding species; these were characterised by scarce rejuvenation and high tree mortality. Bio-physical patterns indicated that previous logging impacts persisted and continued to influence seedling establishment, sapling growth/survival, and—ultimately—species composition. Nutrient patterns were mostly explained by interactions with certain tree species and tree foliage cover, as modulated by terrain and logging impacts. Development trajectories of TAGB over the next 10–20 years could not be predicted easily since (1) many functionally important late-succession species (e.g. dipterocarps) were very scarce; (2) the sizes of initially established light-demanding species appeared to meet limits, including increasing tree mortality; and (3) rejuvenation and species succession differed locally and proceeded along largely unpredictable pathways. Some suggestions for further research are made.@@@Second-growth evergreen monsoon forest

Willows are usually planted in marginal lands like flood prone areas. For willow plantations developed from rootless cuttings, the establishment phase is crucial, because the cuttings are still developing a shoot and root system and have a higher vulnerability to stress. A flooding episode during this early period may have a negative effect upon plants. We analyzed the responses to flooding of eight willow genotypes, representing important species from the economic and ecological point of view (Salix alba, S. matsudana, S. amygdaloides and S. matsudana × S. nigra hybrids). The treatments started when the plants were 2 months old and lasted for 3 weeks. They were identified as: Control (watered to field capacity); F10 (plants submerged 10 cm above soil surface) and F50 (plants submerged 50 cm above soil surface). The F50 treatment showed a greater growth reduction than the F10 treatment in most clones, either measured in height, diameter or total biomass. Both flooding treatments reduced significantly the root-to-shoot ratio compared to control plants. The F50 treatment increased the leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area in all genotypes. Both treatments changed plant and leaf traits in different ways according to the depth of the floodwater. These changes may have lasting effects on growth recovery in the post-flooding period. Willow clones with a fast initial growth will be the best option to minimize growth reduction in areas prone to experience flooding episodes.@@@Flooding

Such factors also interact with each other, complicating the understanding of causal links. IN particular, resource allocation is sensitive to reproductive investment, especially in masting species, which in turn is regulated by climatic variables. Both resource allocation and seed production patterns are also sensitive to tree age. This study aims to (1) evaluate the effects of tree age and local and regional climate on tree ring width and seed production by Spanish black pine (Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii) forest in Cuenca Mountains (Spain), and (2) assess the relationship between seed production and secondary growth of Spanish black pine. Seed fall was estimated using 60 rectangular seed traps (40 × 50 × 15 cm) from 2000 to 2014, randomly distributed across the study area. Standardized tree-ring chronologies were calculated using a random sample of 106 trees stratified into three age classes (> 80 years; 26–80 years, and ≤ 25 years). Local climate data was obtained from a meteorological station, and regional climate data from the CRU-TS 3.1 dataset. Average seed production ranged over time from 2 to 189 seeds m−2 (coefficient of variation = 157%). We identified four masting years (2000, 2003, 2006, and 2014) using a classification based on percentile seed production. Seed production was regulated by climate of the previous 2–3 years, while tree growth responded to precipitation and temperature in the previous and current year. Independent of climate, high seed production had a negative effect on tree ring width and weakened climate growth relationships, indicating resource depletion. Tree age modulated climate sensitivity, increasing correlations between climate and tree-ring index in older trees. P. nigra has been showed to be a climate sensitive species with a bimodal masting behaviour, which should be taking into account for management purposes and silvicultural guidelines under climate change scenarios.@@@Masting

We evaluated the long-term response (9 years-old) of E. globulus across a gradient of sites to different intensity levels of free area of competing vegetation around individual tree seedlings. Competing vegetation intensity levels considered free areas ranging between 0 (control) to 2.54 m2 plus a treatment with total weed control. Competing vegetation biomass production during the first growing season was 2.9, 6.5, 2.2 and 12.9 Mg ha−1, for sites ranging from low to high annual rainfall. Across sites, maximum response in stand volume ranged between 58 and 262 m3 ha−1 at age 9 years and was proportional to the amount of competing biomass controlled during the first growing season. Total competing vegetation control showed the largest response in stand volume at sites with 2.9 and 12.9 Mg ha−1 of competing vegetation. However, the 2.54 m2 vegetation control treatment showed the maximum response for sites with 2.2 and 6.5 Mg ha−1 of competing vegetation. The duration of response for vegetation control treatments ranged between 5 and 9 years. However, at the site with the largest accumulation of competing vegetation biomass the response to vegetation control showed a sustained and divergent response. Our results suggest that vegetation control improved site resources acquisition increasing long-term stand productivity by reducing environmental limitations to tree growth differentially at each site.@@@Weed control

However, generic equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height, basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by a simple power-law model (R2 > 0.93). The incorporation of species-specific height–diameter relationships and total height as additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for 10–58% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between 1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha−1, yielding 0.6–4.3 Mg C ha−1, far exceeding the biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Overall, the allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and verifying carbon stocks in young forests.@@@Carbon stock

The present study examines the extent by which tree biodiversity could potentially be maximized in the context of the pan-African Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGW). Towards this end, ten indigenous tree species were selected for study in the Ferlo region in Northern Senegal based on previous ethnobotanical studies in the zone. The species included Acacia senegal, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis subsp. raddiana, Acacia seyal, Adansonia digitata, Balanites aegyptiaca, Dalbergia melanoxylon, Sclerocarya birrea, Tamarindus indica and Ziziphus mauritiana. Germination experiments were first performed in the laboratory on seed lots from Senegal, Burkina Faso, Kenya, and South Africa prior to in situ sapling production in the nursery in Northern Senegal situated along the GGW. A split plot field design was employed and the effects of seed provenance (two per species) and the addition of organic fertilizer at the timing of planting were determined. Over the course of the 2 year experimental period, the newly planted trees, in addition to the naturally regenerating woody vegetation and herbaceous grasses were monitored in the fenced-in experimental field plot. Of the ten species, only B. aegyptiaca, A. tortilis subsp. raddiana, and S. birrea exhibited moderate survival rates. The effects of provenance and fertilizer addition were sporadic and species-dependent. Natural regeneration of woody species was abundant albeit characterized by low biodiversity whereas herbaceous grass species showed extensive biodiversity, especially under tree canopies as compared to open areas.@@@Indigenous African trees

We experimentally imposed a 1.8 °C increase of air temperature to the cuttings of two common poplar species Populus yunnanensis and Populus szechuanica naturally growing in southwest China using open-top chambers. Populus yunnanensis is distributed along a narrower elevation range compared with P. szechuanica. We determined some key physiological parameters and plant growth regulator activities during the growing season without soil water limitation. Our results showed that a 1.8 °C increase in air temperature increased shoot growth of P. szechuanica through an extension of its growth period but did not affect the growth of P. yunnanensis. Malondialdehyde content, guaiacol peroxidase activities and abscisic acid content increased while indoleacetic acid content decreased in P. yunnanensis. Our results suggest that the two common poplar species in southwest China should be able to adapt to the moderate increase in temperature projected for future climate. The growth of P. szechuanica may benefit through phenological adjustment but a further increase in temperature may inhibit the growth of P. yunnanensis. For poplar plantation management, selecting species with a wide natural distribution range could provide an adaptive alternative for buffering anthropogenic induced increase in temperature and help in sustaining productivity for the long term.@@@Global warming

Because most of the current Eucalyptus transformation methods rely on juvenile seedling tissues as explants, the resulting transgenics are subjected to phenotypic segregation through the use of segregated seedlings. This is unsuitable for transformation of selected Eucalyptus breeding lines, especially the interspecific hybrids. Here, we developed an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method using peeled nodal-stem explants from in vitro-propagated plantlets of a Eucalyptus hybrid. The explant was prepared by peeling off epidermal layers around the axillary buds using a pair of forceps, before co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transgenic shoots generated from the axillary buds were then obtained through kanamycin selection. The transformation efficiency was at most 24% as confirmed by PCR and GUS assay. Transformation of a E. camaldulensis × E. tereticornis F1 hybrid clone using yeast HAL2 showed that, out of 35, 11 transgenic plantlets had an increase in salt tolerance and grew and developed roots, though at a slow rate, on the medium supplemented with NaCl up to 300 mM concentration. This work demonstrates the efficiency of this transformation method for further genetic improvement of Eucalyptus clones selected through hybridization and breeding.@@@Abiotic stress

Here, we propose a climate-based seed zone system for Mexico to address observed and projected climate change. The proposed seed zone classification is based on bands of climate variables often related to genetic adaptation of tree species: mean coldest month temperature (MCMT) and an aridity index (AHM). The overlay of the MCMT and AHM for the 1961–1990 period resulted in 63 climate-based zones. Climate change observed over the last three decades has resulted in an increase of + 0.74 °C for MCMT and a shift toward overall drier conditions across Mexico. By the 2050s, MCMT is expected to increase by + 1.7 °C and AHM shifts further towards drier conditions. We recommend moving seed sources from warm, dry locations towards currently wetter and cooler planting sites, to compensate for climate change that has already occurred and is expected to continue for the next decades. We contribute a straight-forward climate-based seed zone system that allows practitioners to match seed procurement regions with planting regions under observed and anticipated climate change. Our transfer recommendations using climate-based zones can be implemented within the existing seed zone system, which often span large climate gradients.@@@Climate change adaptation

Artificial regeneration is an alternative to natural regeneration, but is difficult, in part, due to large variation in seedling quality. In this study, we examined the effects of acorn size and mass on nursery seedling morphological parameters commonly used to quantify seedling quality, and we determined if genetic factors affected these relationships. Acorns were collected from six open-pollinated orchard trees (i.e., six half-sib families), and were separated into six size classes based on acorn diameter (ranging from 1.3 to 2.5 cm). Samples from each size class were weighed for total fresh mass. Acorns were sown in a commercial bareroot nursery in Polk County, Tennessee, USA, and seedlings were grown for 1 year using nursery protocols to maximize growth. Seedling survival was generally not affected by acorn size class or mass, except one family had higher survival in the larger acorn size classes. Five of the six families had no discernable relationship between acorn size class and seedling size. Acorn mass was positively related to seedling morphology, but relationships were weak (R2 ≤ 0.11) and biologically insignificant. Neither acorn size nor mass could be used reliably to predict seedling survival or morphological indicators of seedling quality. We hypothesized that results were affected by an unusually long growing season and advanced fertilization regimes at the nursery, which may have negated acorn size/mass effects on seedling growth. Family affected relationships between acorn size/mass and seedling morphology, indicating that family selections could improve overall seedling quality.@@@Artificial regeneration

Although much FLR will consist of conventional ecological restoration, a substantial proportion will involve agroforestry. The question therefore arises of how the agroforestry germplasm needs of FLR can be met, particularly given its emphasis on species diversity. This paper examines the role of market-based germplasm supply systems. A simple analytic framework is presented, and key demand- and supply-related factors are described. It is suggested that seedling supply and demand at market prices will not necessarily coincide with needs of all farmers nor with the requirements of a particular restoration program, and that market-based germplasm supply systems will therefore often not meet the needs of restoration programs. Implications of these findings are then identified and appropriate responses are suggested. These include those intended to produce shifts in demand or supply curves through addressing the underlying enabling environment, and direct subsidies to tree planting stock prices.@@@Tree seedling demand

The amenability of this species to propagation by leafy stem cuttings in low-cost non-mist propagators was assessed in four separate experiments. These experiments evaluated the effects of (1) genotype (15 genotypes from two island provenances), (2) cutting position on the stock plant (apical, medial and basal), (3) cutting size (1-node/400 mm2 and 2-node/800 mm2 leaf area), (4) three propagation media [scoria (5 mm, air-filled porosity (AFP)—29%), vermiculite and perlite (1:1 v/v, AFP—46%) and vermiculite, perlite and peat (2:2:1 v/v/v, AFP—42%)], (5) indole-3-butyric (IBA) (3000, 4000 and 8000 ppm) and (6) irradiance in the propagator [daily light integral (DLI) 5.3, 3.9, 2.6, 2.2 mol m−2 day−1]. IBA, propagation media and cutting size had no significant effect on rooting percentage, root number or root growth. Evidence of provenance-based variation in rooting capacity was recorded with greater rooting success for genotypes from the island of Erromango compared with Tanna. Variation in adventitious root induction was also recorded between individual genotypes from Erromango across all four experiments. Cuttings collected from the apical and medial parts of the shoot on the stock plant had higher rooting percentage than those collected from the base. Differences in rooting capacity between apical and medial shoots were variable between experiments and may be attributed to different levels of hardening. The use of artificial shade (~ 70%) to achieve a mean DLI of between 2.6 and 3.9 mol m−2 day−1 increased rooting percentage compared to both lower (2.2 mol m−2 day−1 or ~ 90% shade) and higher (5.3 mol m−2 day−1 or ~ 50% shade) irradiance treatments. Leaf retention of cuttings in the propagator was positively associated with the percentage of cuttings with adventitious roots, with highest percentage in cuttings with full leaf retention, regardless of original cutting size. This study demonstrated S. austrocaledonicum seedlings can be successfully propagated by cuttings provided the propagation conditions are optimized for each genotype.@@@Sandalwood

Five herbicides, flumioxazin, imazamox, imazapic, oxyfluorfen, and sulfometuron methyl, were evaluated at either pre- or post-weed emergence timing for selective weed control in the establishment of Eucalyptus benthamii, a frost-tolerant species showing promise for commercial plantations in the southeastern United States and southern Brazil. Herbicides were applied at two or three rates and compared to a non-treated control and to near-complete weed control obtained with repeated glyphosate directed sprays. Herbicides were most efficacious when applied prior to weed emergence, at 2 weeks after planting 16-week-old containerized eucalyptus seedlings. Pre-emergence imazapic treatments resulted in broad-spectrum and persistent weed control, with 77–82% bare-ground at 60 days after treatment, but both pre- and post-emergence applications of imazapic caused excessive eucalyptus injury at the highest rate tested. Imazapic, sulfometuron, and imazamox were most effective for grass control. Both timings of flumioxazin were effective for forb control at the early assessment. All pre-emergence treatments enhanced stem volume compared to the non-treated control, but post-emergence treatments did not, suggesting the need for early weed control to facilitate E. benthamii growth. Pre-emergence applications of medium and high sulfometuron, low imazapic, high imazamox, and high oxyfluorfen rates increased stem volume four-fold to six-fold compared to the non-treated control. Repeated glyphosate directed sprays increased stem volume nearly three-fold compared to the control. These results confirm one early report of flumioxazin effectiveness and identify imazamox and imazapic as new selective herbicides for eucalyptus culture.@@@Herbicide tolerance

However, few studies have addressed the ecological impacts of fodder tree harvesting. We investigated the species harvested and the techniques used, and the effects of fodder harvesting on (1) species’ populations and (2) forest carbon stocks in three montane forests in Kenya. Focus-group discussions were organized in 36 villages to determine which species were harvested and with which techniques. Field observations were made on vegetation plots: stem diameter, tree height, species and extent of harvest were recorded. Carbon stocks were calculated using an allometric equation with (1) observed height of harvested trees, and (2) potential height estimated with a power model, and results were compared. Eight tree species were commonly harvested for fodder using different techniques (some branches, main stem, most branches except stem apex). Fodder harvesting (together with other uses for some species) negatively affected one species populations (Olea europaea), it did not negatively affect four (Drypetes gerrardii, Gymnosporia heterophylla, Pavetta gardeniifolia, Xymalos monospora), and more information is needed for three species (Olea capensis, Prunus africana, Rinorea convallarioides). Fodder harvesting did not significantly reduce forest carbon stocks, suggesting that local communities could continue using these fodder trees if a carbon project is established. Among the fodder species studied, X. monospora could be used in reforestation programs, as it has multiple uses and can withstand severe pruning. Although our study is only a snapshot, it is a baseline which can be used to monitor changes in fodder harvesting and its impacts related to increasing droughts in northern Kenya and increasing human populations.@@@Carbon stocks

To address a problem of limited information on seed source variation from across its natural and planted range for key economic traits, two seed source trials were established in Sri Lanka in 2008. These included 3 Sri Lankan landrace and 21 natural stand sources from sub-Saharan Africa. Both trials were assessed for height and survival at age 2 years and then diameter at breast height, total height and stem form traits at age 6 years. Significant differences (P < 0.01) were found between seed sources for all traits at both sites. Significant differences were also found among seed sources in one trial for within seed source variability of tree volume and other traits, with two local Sri Lankan sources showing some of the highest variabilities. Whilst analyses of data pooled across the two sites revealed significant (P < 0.01) seed source by site interaction effects for most traits, such interactions will be of little practical significance for growth as correlations (r values) of seed source means across the two sites were moderate and positive, but for stem form traits correlations between the sites were low to very low and not significant. Options for future genetic improvement of the species in Sri Lanka are discussed.@@@African mahogany

A rise in the mean temperature and a variation in rainfall patterns could modify the current distribution of plant species. In this study, we analysed four evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex subsp. ilex, Q. ilex subsp. ballota, Q. suber and Q. coccifera) by means of species distribution models. Three algorithms were used: maximum entropy, logistic regression and environmental distance. Taxa occurrences were taken, chiefly from the National Forest Inventories, and climate data was retrieved from the WorldClim 1.4 project. The present period and four future scenarios were studied. The latter were carried out by averaging thirteen global circulation models (GCMs). Area under the curve was used for validating the models. Maps indicating the suitability and cosuitability among the evergreen oaks were developed. The potential distribution of evergreen oaks in the present period was found to be wider than the actual distribution. Simulations indicate that climate change would increase the cosuitability of western temperate areas for Mediterranean oaks. The use of different algorithms and GCMs, as well as the high validation values obtained, make the study robust. Oaks are an important source of income, especially Q. ilex subsp. ballota and Q. suber.

The objective of this study was to determine the response of Eucalyptus urograndis to N, P, and K in two regions of Parana State (Jaguariaíva and Ventania) on a sandy oxisol following two harvest cycles of Pinus taeda. Site preparation prior to the new experiment included the application of rock phosphate (26.2 kg ha−1 of P) by in-row subsoiling. Five rates of N and P (0, 13, 26, 52, and 105 kg ha−1) and K (0, 29, 58, 116, and 232 kg ha−1) were separately tested. Treatment response was evaluated by determining maximum technical efficiency, height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after planting, and volume at 36 months. At all assessments, N additions did not influence growth parameters indicating that N demands were met by organic matter/litter mineralization. Phosphorus enhanced growth until the 18th month, with maximum gains at months 9 and 6 for Jaguariaíva and Ventania (56 and 59% of DBH for the 105 kg ha−1 P rate, respectively). Potassium improved growth only after the 24th month; maximum rate occurred at 166 kg ha−1 of K with a volume of 163 m3 ha−1 at the Jaguariaíva site at 36 months. In conclusion, findings indicated that Eucalyptus urograndis grown in southern Brazil could be responsive to P and K fertilization, but not to the addition of N fertilizer.@@@Eucalyptus

To investigate the allelopathic effects of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter, the photosynthetic physiology of seedlings of two recipient plants, Cynodon dactylon and Medicago sativa, were measured in this controlled study. As the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased continuously, and the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased continuously in both recipient plants. In M. sativa, all abovementioned indices differed significantly compared with the control group: Pn, Gs, and Tr decreased by 41.69, 59.35, and 48.02%, respectively, and Ci increased by 28.53%. In C. dactylon, Gs decreased significantly by 27.27%. Analysis of the photosynthesis–light response curve indicated that the maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pnmax) and dark respiration rate (Rd) of C. dactylon, as well as Pnmax and light saturation point (Lsp) of M. sativa, decreased significantly as the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased. These results indicated that the photosynthetic traits, light adaptation ability and physiological metabolism of recipient plants were affected by the treatment. The decreased photosynthesis was caused by the changes in pigments and soluble sugar contents induced by L. leucocephala leaf litter and is therefore considered to be associated with non-stomatal limitations. In addition, as the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased, M. sativa showed decreased chlorophyll (Chla) and carotenoid (Car) contents, while C. dactylon showed decreased Chla and Chl(a + b) contents. However, both recipient plants exhibited significantly increases in their soluble sugar content. Overall, M. sativa was more sensitive than C. dactylon to the allelopathic effects induced by decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter.@@@Allelopathy

The goal of this study was to evaluate the second rotation biomass yields and stem growth for 30 willow cultivars established in Saskatchewan, Canada in 2007, and coppiced at the end of the first growing season. Detailed stem measurements were collected and all biomass was harvested at the end of the 2010 (first rotation data) and 2013 (second rotation data) growing seasons. The average 3-year cumulative biomass production across all cultivars was 8.1 oven-dry (OD) Mg ha−1 in the second rotation (ranging from 0.6 to 21.3 OD Mg ha−1). The three highest yielding cultivars were Taberg, Tully Champion, and Otisco, with annual production of 6.4–7.1 OD Mg ha−1 year−1 in biomass, which was an increase by 12–44% from the first rotation, and more than double the average for all 30 cultivars (2.7 OD Mg ha−1 year−1), and had an average stool-within-plot survival rate of 81–94%. The 20 lowest clones suffered from higher mortality, which resulted in lower biomass production in the second rotation. These data suggest that the top 10 willow cultivars have a promising potential as a bioenergy source, but more data are needed from the third and successive rotations before a sustainable biomass industry could be established in the Canadian Prairies.@@@Salix sp.

However, selection of diverse native species for reforestation is difficult, requiring consideration of the preferences of different stakeholders. In this study we identify species to be included in reforestation of an ecologically important watershed in North Lebanon based on ratings produced by stakeholders from Lebanon’s public, private and academic sectors. Twenty-two tree species being produced in Lebanese nurseries were identified as ecologically suitable by experts. Stakeholders (n = 34) were asked to rate these 22 species according to conservation priority and ecological suitability in an online survey. Although there was a high degree of variability in ratings among respondents, those who identified as biodiversity-focused did not differ from those who identified as forestry-focused. Looking within the two foci, we found significant variability among forestry-focused respondents but not among biodiversity-focused respondents. Although there was no significant difference in ratings between biodiversity- and forestry-focussed respondents, the resultant rankings differed considerably. We also found significant variability in preferences within forestry-focussed but not biodiversity-focussed respondents. Weighting by respondents’ knowledge of species had little effect on rankings. The variability in preferences between stakeholders, including the considerable within-group variability we found among forestry-focused respondents, highlights the importance of soliciting preferences from multiple stakeholders when selecting species to be used in reforestation efforts.@@@Biodiversity

Scientific experts forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation in the Argentine Patagonian Cordillera. Knowledge of the variation of adaptive traits at the seedling stage is crucial to prediction the adaptability of forest tree species. We aim to analyze genetic variation in root and shoot quantitative traits among and within natural populations of two key North Patagonian forest species, in order to evaluate their ability to deal with CC through adaptation. We established two common garden nursery trials: (1) 81 open pollinated families of Nothofagus obliqua from eight natural populations, and (2) 74 families of Nothofagus alpina from seven populations. At the end of the first growing season we measured shoot height, diameter, root length and root and stem dry biomass; we also estimated foliage biomass. In addition the root to stem ratio, specific root length and the root to shoot ratio were calculated. For both species intra-population variation was generally low, and average differentiation was moderate, with high levels of differentiation in some traits related to drought stress, indicating low adaptation capacity but also adaptation to current stressful conditions, which means it may be possible for some populations to survive CC without changing their genetic structures. Further studies are needed, including phenotypic plasticity assays, to complete the picture.@@@Allometry

American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) is a threatened forest tree in the eastern USA that may become an important species option for mine reclamation. Chestnut restoration using backcross hybrids that incorporate blight resistance may be targeted to the Appalachian coal mining region, which corresponds closely with the species’ native range. Thus, it is important to understand how chestnut hybrids perform relative to progenitors on reclamation sites to develop restoration prescriptions. Seeds of parents and three backcross generations of chestnut (100% American, 100% Chinese, and BC1F3, BC2F3, and BC3F2 hybrids) were planted into mine soils in West Virginia, USA with shelter treatments. Survival for all stock types was 44% after 8 years (American 39%, Chinese 77%, BC1F3 40%, BC2F3 28%, and BC3F2 35%). Height for all stock types was 33 cm after 8 years (American 28 cm, Chinese 67 cm, BC1F3 30 cm, BC2F3 21 cm, and BC3F2 20 cm). At another site a year later, seedlings of the chestnut stock types were planted into brown (pH 4.6) or gray sandstone (pH 6.3) mine soils and seedling survival across all stock types was 58% after 7 years. Chinese had the highest survival at 82%, while the others ranged from 38 to 66%. Height was 63 cm for all stock types after 7 years. More advanced backcross hybrids (BC2F3 and BC3F2) had the lowest vigor ratings at both sites after 7–8 years. Our results indicate that surface mines in Appalachia may provide a land base for planting blight-resistant chestnuts, although Chinese chestnut outperformed American chestnut and later generation backcross hybrids. As blight-resistant chestnuts establish and spread after planting, chestnut trees may become a component of the forest canopy again and possibly occupy its former niche, but their spread may alter future forest stand dynamics.@@@Forestry reclamation approach

In this study, two thinning experiments were carried out in 22- and 36-year-old NLA plantations in Sakarya in order to determine the effects of different thinning intensity (unthinned or the control, removal of 22.3 and 39.4% of the basal area) on mean diameter, basal area and volume growth of the whole stand, those of the 100 largest trees in the stand and trees of initial diameter size class after 10 years. A randomized block design with three replications was used in both experiments. Ten-year results of selective low thinning treatments indicated that thinning significantly increased diameter increments, which were positively correlated with the thinning intensity in both plantations when compared to the control. Heavy thinning increased the increment of mean stand diameter but did not significantly affect the basal area or volume of the stand in either of the experiments. However, in the first experiment, basal area and volume increments differed significantly among treatments, increasing with thinning intensity for the 100 largest trees. In the second experiment, although not statistically significant, the basal area and volume increments also increased with thinning intensity for the 100 largest trees. Moreover, all measured increments were higher in the younger plantation than in the older. These results showed that different thinning intensities applied in NLA plantations can produce similar basal area and volume increments. Consequently, to maximize diameter growth and increase crop tree value, heavy thinning treatments can be recommended, particularly for young NLA plantations at bottomland sites.@@@Fraxinus angustifolia

Two of those operational forest plantations were monitored from age 1 to 3 years-old (2014–2016). Some plant attributes and soil volumetric water content (VWC) were monitored for eight native tree species (Acacia caven, Schinus polygamus, Porlieria chilensis, Lithraea caustica, Quillaja saponaria, Cryptocarya alba, Drimys winteri and Maytenus boaria), and a water balance model fitted to assess plant water use. Site preparation comprised planting holes of 40 cm × 40 cm by 50 cm in depth dug with a backhoe. Substrate was removed and mixed with compost in proportion 70:30 before mixing it in the planting hole. Planting holes acted as water reservoirs over the study period with soil VWC generally increasing with soil depth being also less variable deeper than in the upper soil layers. The ratio of adaxial (upper leaf side) to abaxial (lower leaf side) stomatal conductance approximately followed a species gradient from xeric to mesic. Irrigation represented about 26% and 53% of the total water input for the sclerophyll and the D. winteri plantation, respectively. At the plant level (0.4 × 0.4 m), soil evaporation and transpiration of D. winteri (273 and 232 mm year−1, equivalent to 43.7 and 37.1 L plant−1, respectively) were about twofold the values for the sclerophyllous/malacophyllous plantation (138 and 128 mm year−1, 22.1 and 20.5 L plant−1, respectively). We suggest the water budget for the sclerophyll/malacophyllous plantation was tight but feasible to be adjusted while for D. winteri irrigation was excessive, could be drastically reduced, and suppressed altogether if planted in gullies. We believe water balance models and soil moisture content sensors could be used to better plan and manage irrigation frequency and amounts in compensation forest plantations in semiarid central Chile.@@@Water balance

Borkh) and oaks (Quercus spp.) have been negatively impacted by forest changes over the past century. Many mature, introduced pine (Pinus spp.) plantations exist in the Midwest US following establishment 50–60 years ago yet have little economic and ecological value. As oak and chestnut have similar site preferences to pines, these stands may be ideal sites for hardwood restoration plantings. We sought to determine optimal management strategies for converting pine plantations by manipulating their canopies. We underplanted hybrid American chestnut and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings into three canopy treatments (control, shelterwood, clearcut) and included an open field treatment. For each of two growing seasons, 0, 30, or 60 g 19N–6P–12K of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) were also applied to seedlings. Soil chemical parameters and leaf nutrients were analyzed throughout the study. Chestnut and oak seedlings had significantly greater height after two growing seasons in the clearcut and shelterwood than the control and open field, and chestnut had significantly greater diameter as well. Chestnut height and RCD growth were threefold that of oak after two growing seasons. In general, fertilization increased seedling growth more in the clearcut and open field than shelterwood and control for both species. Soils had significantly higher pH, K, and S in the open field than in pine stands. Results suggest that pine plantations may serve as target sites for restoration of these hardwood species. Shelterwoods and clearcuts are both favorable conversion options for oak and chestnut, and addition of CRF may augment further growth increase, especially in open environments.@@@American chestnut

This is because longleaf pine establishment often has the dual-purpose of ecosystem restoration and stemwood production. Timely recovery of scorched foliage among longleaf pine seedlings and saplings supports maximum juvenile growth. We identified two means of foliage re-establishment in the growing season after prescribed fire regardless of the season of fire application. New foliage growth after spring or fall fire was correlated with un-scorched foliage biomass and the presence of lateral branches. After prescribed fire in spring, foliage biomass recovery also appeared to benefit from the mobilization of starch. The high carbon demand of foliage recovery after fall prescribed fire was associated with interruption of seasonal starch accumulation in the stem and taproot. The implication of low starch accumulation in stem and taproot tissues during the growing season after fall prescribed fire is unknown and warrants further investigation. Our results demonstrate a positive influence of residual foliage, lateral branches, and stored starch on timely foliage recovery of young longleaf pines after fire. Together with knowledge of longleaf pine development and fuel and climate conditions at the time of prescribed fire, this information will aid prescribed fire practitioners charged with maintaining longleaf pine stands of high vigor.@@@Grass stage

While the technique has been used in other tree species, it has not been applied for reforestation projects. In this study we used the WSI approach for newly planted Douglas-fir in the Pacific Northwest (USA), where the Mediterranean climate, plant community development, and competition for water all play key roles in the success of establishment efforts. In this study, previously reported seedling growth, xylem water potential, and soil moisture data were utilized to provide direct correlations between Douglas-fir productivity, soil water availability and WSI. For each growing season, a strong relationship between WSI and volume growth as well as a strong linear relationship between WSI and soil moisture measured during mid-August was found. On average, for each reduction of 0.01 cm3 cm−3 in soil moisture measured during mid-August, Douglas-fir seedling volume growth decreased by 5.6 and 7.7% in the first and second growing seasons, respectively. Preserving soil moisture until early-August through the judicial application of vegetation management regimes was critical for maximizing stand productivity. Based on these results, a single evaluation of soil volumetric water content during early-August can be used as a predictor of stand productivity during the initial two seasons of forest establishment.@@@Forest vegetation management

Franco var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) seedlings. Vegetation management treatments may increase soil moisture availability during the dry summer months, thereby increasing the probability of seedling survival. Chemical site preparation treatments were applied in spring 2007, summer 2007, and spring 2008 to determine if such treatments would improve survival and growth of bareroot Douglas-fir and bareroot and plug western larch seedlings on three sites near Elgin, Oregon. Although some herbicide treatments significantly increased survival, results were not consistent among sites. Overall, Douglas-fir had greater survival after 7–8 years than larch seedlings. Seedling size 7–8 years after planting was also highly variable among sites and treatments with larch seedlings being taller and larger than Douglas-fir seedlings, on the average. Size for all stock types was negatively correlated with vegetative cover and positively correlated with first-year soil moisture. Macro- and microclimatic conditions, including topography and soil depth, were likely contributors to differences in survival and growth.@@@Vegetation management

Poplars are currently the highest producing tree species available and are therefore natural choices for biomass-oriented production. Growing poplars has been of most interest on agricultural land, but the knowledge and experience about their cultivation is still limited. Factors that have a large impact on the regeneration results are plant material, competing vegetation, browsing and damage caused by voles or climatic factors. Due to large establishment costs, there is a need to find methods to secure the establishment both biologically and economically. In this study the effect of plastic mulch in combination with three different plant types (short cuttings, long cuttings and rooted plants) were tested at three different sites. Five years after planting, the overall effect of mulch was an improved plant survival and growth. In most cases, long cuttings outperformed short cuttings and rooted plants. Clonal differences were present, indicating the importance of using plant material adapted to site conditions. All sites were heavily affected by browsing and during the experimental period 100% of the plants were damaged at some point. Planting poplars without fencing is therefore doubtful. Results from this study conclude that poplars can be established with success on agricultural land if proper measures are used depending on the site to be planted.@@@Browsing

We examined relationships between understory light, varying overstory tree retention, and growth of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens; commercial species) and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) stump sprouts initiated by group selection and single-tree selection harvesting in 80–100 year old mixed stands at four sites. Treatments included a complete harvest in 1-ha group selection openings, low-density dispersed retention, and either aggregated or dispersed high-density retention. Post-harvest stand density index and basal area were useful predictors of understory light. Mean and maximum understory light did not differ significantly between treatments with the same density where residual trees were retained in aggregated versus dispersed spatial patterns. However, the dispersed retention had lower minimum light levels when compared to the aggregated retention treatment. Aspect appeared to influence understory light more in dispersed treatments. At all light levels, the dominant sprout within clumps of redwood stump sprouts generally grew faster than dominant tanoak sprouts within tanoak sprout clumps. Differences in sprout height growth between aggregated and dispersed treatments were minimal. Stump size had a significant effect on redwood stump sprout height growth, with sprouts on the largest stumps growing approximately twice as quickly as sprouts on the smallest stumps. In the low density dispersed treatment, redwood sprouts outperformed tanoak sprouts by the greatest margin. Regeneration of redwood and tanoak was most rapid within group selection openings.@@@Coppice

Franco), can be a means of mitigating the effects of climate change by meeting the growing demand for biomass and high quality wood. The aim of this study was to investigate early growth, survival and damage from late-spring frost and winter desiccation. A provenance trial with four coastal and three interior provenances of Douglas-fir originating from British Columbia, Canada, was established in Southwest Sweden (56°43′N, 13°08′E). Seedling height, length of the leading shoot, and occurrence of frost damage, were measured after one, three, and six growing seasons. Timing of bud break in spring was also observed. The interior Douglas-fir were more frequently damaged by late-spring frost compared to the coastal Douglas-fir. The interior Douglas-fir still had a higher survival after six growing seasons compared to the coastal variety. All provenances were damaged by winter desiccation, but the provenances originating from the coastal area were more severely damaged. Choice of variety may reduce the risk for either late-spring frost or winter desiccation.@@@Climate change

Site preparation is one of the most important measures for reducing these risks and as several studies have shown the damage is highly dependent on the amount of pure mineral soil around the seedlings. We investigated effects of three site preparation techniques: (1) disc trenching with a conventional Bracke T26, (2) MidiFlex unit and (3) soil inversion with a Karl Oskar unit on characteristics of the planting spots, growth and pine weevil damage and survival rates of untreated and insecticide treated planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings. All three site preparation techniques reduced pine weevil damage in comparison with no site preparation, and the proportion of spots with pure mineral soil they created was inversely related to the rate of mortality caused by pine weevil. The results indicate that the quality of the planting spots depends on the technique used. In areas where pine weevil is the major threat to seedling survival, the amount of mineral soil in the planting spots is the most important factor in order to protect the seedling from damage. Without site preparation most planting spots consisted of undisturbed humus. Generally, the Karl-Oskar created the most spots with pure mineral soil, but on very stony soils the Bracke T26 created more mineral soil spots than other methods. Site preparation is a valuable tool in order to improve survival in regeneration areas and it is of great importance to make the right choice of technique depending on the particular circumstances on the actual site.@@@Hylobius abietis

Since its introduction into the UK almost a century ago it has become an increasing problem in many woodlands, where it completely shades out other understorey vegetation including young trees, preventing forest regeneration. Climate change is likely to favour its future spread in the UK, and in other regions which currently have a similar climate such as Ireland and northwest Europe. Non chemical management is only practical on a small scale, and to date efforts to control this invasive weed with herbicides have been largely ineffective. In our work we found that a single application of 2.69 kg active ingredient (a.i.) ha−1 picloram [as 11.2 l ha−1 Tordon 22 K (240 g l−1 picloram)] diluted in water plus the adjuvant Mixture B NF at 2% of final spray volume, applied between spring and midsummer, killed all treated plants within two growing seasons. Treatment with 3.84 kg a.i. ha−1 triclopyr [as 8 l ha−1 Timbrel (480 g l−1 triclopyr)] diluted in water plus Mixture B NF at 2% of final spray volume, sprayed initially when flower buds are swelling or flushed but vegetative buds are largely dormant (late April in southern Britain), with a repeat application made 4–8 weeks later, was also very effective. If triclopyr or picloram cannot be used, we also found that glyphosate can provide some control, but follow up treatment will be required. In addition, silvicultural practices such as the high density planting of heavily shade bearing species should be adopted to discourage subsequent reinfestation of cleared areas.@@@Salal

An important tool for meeting objectives of these global initiatives is reforestation, achieved by natural processes or by tree planting. Worldwide, organizations are challenged to most efficiently and effectively direct resources to the most critical reforestation needs. Currently in the United States, the reforestation efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, are challenged by changes in policy, funding, climate change, and mega-fires, to name a few, and identifying strategies for timely successful reforestation at scale is needed. A 2016 conference brought together reforestation experts from across North America to discuss potential benefits of reforestation activities in the face of mounting challenges from invasive species, wildfires, diseases, and climate change. As a result of that effort, here we provide background on the challenges confronting successful reforestation on lands managed by the Forest Service, and describe the six manuscripts in this special issue and their foci: barriers to natural regeneration, when to actively plant trees or not to ensure a heterogeneous landscape, ecological and economic concerns when reforestation is delayed, employing traditional and novel silvicultural techniques in support of reforestation, leveraging reforestation to improve resilience of species affected by introduced pests, and the potential carbon sequestration benefits of a robust reforestation program.@@@Natural regeneration

The regeneration for resilience (R4R) framework provides a decision structure to prioritize limited resources and utilize artificial and natural regeneration management to offer the best likelihood of success in positioning stands and landscapes to support multi-generational self-sustaining host populations in the presence of the nonnative invader by (1) increasing host population size to offset invader-caused mortality, (2) increasing the frequency of genetic resistance traits in host populations in habitats that enable their expression and durability to retard future mortality and facilitate population sustainability and recovery, and (3) maintain host genetic diversity, adaptive capacity, and population connectivity. This application is designed for conditions where the nonnative invader is expected to be a persistent threat, the host species naturally has some genetic resistance to the invasive species, and the forest host populations are integral to support valued ecosystem processes and services. The R4R framework has been developed for application in high elevation five-needle pine ecosystems of North America impacted and threatened by the nonnative pathogen Cronartium ribicola that causes the lethal disease white pine blister rust (WPBR). Several examples using the R4R framework to integrate information on current forest condition, WPBR risk or hazard, genetic resistance to WPBR, and host population dynamics and silvics to prioritize areas and design interventions are discussed. Effective management of forest regeneration dynamics can increase forest resilience and adaptive capacity to mitigate impacts of invasive species.@@@Pinus albicaulis

In this paper, I illustrate that, as the extensive margins of reforestation and timber harvesting differ, some non-reforestation may be justified financially and economically even in places where market and institutional arrangements encourage reforestation. Nonetheless, considering the environmental benefits of reforestation would reduce the potential area of non-reforestation or the gap between the two margins. I further demonstrate with an example the substantial financial costs of delayed reforestation in the U.S. South and explain why reforestation is not taken on some private and public lands. I conclude with comments on reforestation from public policy and ethical perspectives.@@@Reforestation

"1003","Understanding ecological contexts for active reforestation following wildfires@@@@@@Received: 20 January 2018 Accepted: 19 August 2018 Published: 03 September 2018 Issue Date: 15 January 2019@@@To forestall loss of ecological values associated with forests, land managers need to consider where and when to prioritize active reforestation following major disturbance events. To aid this decision-making process, we summarize recent research findings pertaining to the Sierra Nevada region of California, USA to identify contexts in which active reforestation or passive recovery may best promote desirable post-fire ecological trajectories. Based on our synthesis, we suggest conceptual frameworks for assessing landscape conditions and determining areas that may be the highest priorities for tree planting to avoid persistent loss of conifer forests. Field studies have shown that some large patches of high severity burn can have relatively low levels of natural regeneration, especially among desired pine species. The accumulation of fuels and competition with shrubs and resprouting hardwoods may hinder the reestablishment of mature conifer trees. However, severe fires could also play a restorative role, by promoting non-conifer forested communities, such as meadows, shrubfields, and open forests with significant hardwood components. Such communities were historically rejuvenated and maintained by fire but have been replaced by conifer forest due in part to fire suppression. Reforestation in such areas may run counter to restoring ecological function and the ecosystem services that are provided by non-conifer communities. Through this framework, managers and stakeholders may better understand the contexts in which planting and passive recovery may better support ecological restoration.@@@Natural regeneration

Increasing temperatures and decreasing patterns of precipitation especially in the Mid-South suggest that water stress, drought, and changing patterns of natural disturbance events will challenge managers in the twenty-first century. Efforts to manage southern forest stands in the face of changing climatic conditions will require a diversity of approaches including tactics to promote genetic diversity in natural and planted stands, encouragement of species diversity as new stands develop, and considering ways to promote diverse stand structures that encourage recruitment of new age cohorts within stands on a regular basis. With predicted changes in climatic conditions, forest ecosystems across the South will respond in different ways, depending upon whether or not they are currently being managed. Unmanaged stands will change in unpredictable ways that reflect the absence of management. But in managed stands, silvicultural treatments are available for foresters to apply to respond and adapt to maintain productive forests adapted to those changing conditions. Finally, one approach often advocated to deal with this uncertainty is a strategy for assisted migration, in which species are established in locations beyond their current range, where predicted climatic conditions are likely to occur at some point in the future within which those species will survive. This is basically an exercise in artificial regeneration, but will likely be more complicated than simply planting a few exotic seedlings and hoping for the best. The technical and practical challenges of planting species at the margins or beyond their natural range include a lack of research support especially for species not commonly planted in the region. Moreover, planting is costly, and because of that, intensive practices are more likely on institutional and government lands rather than family forests. In the end, all of these concepts fall within the practice of silviculture, and are tactics with which the profession is familiar.@@@Climate change

"1005","The role of reforestation in carbon sequestration@@@@@@Received: 12 October 2017 Accepted: 24 June 2018 Published: 09 July 2018 Issue Date: 15 January 2019@@@In the United States (U.S.), the maintenance of forest cover is a legal mandate for federally managed forest lands. More broadly, reforestation following harvesting, recent or historic disturbances can enhance numerous carbon (C)-based ecosystem services and functions. These include production of woody biomass for forest products, and mitigation of atmospheric CO2 pollution and climate change by sequestering C into ecosystem pools where it can be stored for long timescales. Nonetheless, a range of assessments and analyses indicate that reforestation in the U.S. lags behind its potential, with the continuation of ecosystem services and functions at risk if reforestation is not increased. In this context, there is need for multiple independent analyses that quantify the role of reforestation in C sequestration, from ecosystems up to regional and national levels. Here, we describe the methods and report the findings of a large-scale data synthesis aimed at four objectives: (1) estimate C storage in major ecosystem pools in forest and other land cover types; (2) quantify sources of variation in ecosystem C pools; (3) compare the impacts of reforestation and afforestation on C pools; (4) assess whether these results hold or diverge across ecoregions. The results of our synthesis support four overarching inferences regarding reforestation and other land use impacts on C sequestration. First, in the bigger picture, soils are the dominant C pool in all ecosystems and land cover types in the U.S., and soil C pool sizes vary less by land cover than by other factors, such as spatial variation or soil wetness. Second, where historically cultivated lands are being reforested, topsoils are sequestering significant amounts of C, with the majority of reforested lands yet to reach their capacity relative to the potential indicated by natural forest soils. Third, the establishment of woody vegetation delivers immediate to multi-decadal C sequestration benefits in aboveground woody biomass and coarse woody debris pools, with two- to three-fold C sequestration benefits in biomass during the first several decades following planting. Fourth, opportunities to enhance C sequestration through reforestation vary among the ecoregions, according to current levels of planting, typical forest growth rates, and past land uses (especially cultivation). Altogether, our results suggest that an immediate, but phased and spatially targeted approach to reforestation can enhance C sequestration in forest biomass and soils in the U.S. for decades to centuries to come.@@@Forest ecosystem

"1006","Barriers to natural regeneration in temperate forests across the USA@@@@@@Received: 19 December 2017 Accepted: 24 November 2018 Published: 23 December 2018 Issue Date: 15 January 2019@@@For millennia, natural disturbance regimes, including anthropogenic fire and hunting practices, have led to forest regeneration patterns that created a diversity of forest lands across the USA. But dramatic changes in climates, invasive species, and human population, and land use have created novel disturbance regimes that are causing challenges to securing desired natural regeneration. Climate is an ever-present background disturbance and determinant of species distribution. Changes in certain other factors such as large herbivore populations, wildfire, and pests modify forest composition and structure, and are common barriers to natural regeneration of desired species. Changes in long-standing disturbance regimes have led to the homogenization of forest landscape composition and structure. Today, forests have low regeneration potential and are low in resilience. They have reduced productivity and are prone to widespread health issues including severe forest mortality. In addition to epidemics of native invasive species due to climate change and availability of habitat at landscape scales, the continued introduction and spread of non-native pests and diseases are causing large-scale forest mortality. These ecological changes have cascading ecological consequences such as increases in severe wildfire, which pose new barriers to natural regeneration. Equally challenging are the barriers to natural regeneration that arise from social, political and economic factors. To address many of these issues requires active management that links all critical stages in the regeneration niche necessary for achieving desired regeneration to sustain forest development and production in a socially acceptable manner and economically viable market system.@@@Natural regeneration

Much degraded land may be targeted for large-scale forest restoration, yet challenges include costs, a shortage of regeneration material and the need for restored forests to serve as a resource for communities. To ensure ecosystem function for the future, forest restoration programs must: (1) learn from the past; (2) integrate ecological knowledge; (3) advance regeneration techniques and systems; (4) overcome biotic and abiotic disturbances and (5) adapt for future forest landscapes. Historical forest conditions, while site-specific, may help to identify the processes that leave long-term legacies in current forests and to understand tree migration biology/population dynamics and their relationship with climate change. Ecological theory around plant–plant interactions has shown the importance of negative (competition) and positive (facilitation) interactions for restoration, which will become more relevant with increasing drought due to climate change. Selective animal browsing influences plant–plant interactions and challenges restoration efforts to establish species-rich forests; an integrated approach is needed to simultaneously manage ungulate populations, landscape carrying capacity and browse-tolerant regeneration. A deeper understanding of limiting factors that affect plant establishment will facilitate nursery and site preparation systems to overcome inherent restoration challenges. Severe anthropogenic disturbances connected to global change have created unprecedented pressure on forests, necessitating novel ecological engineering, genetic conservation of tree species and landscape-level approaches that focus on creating functional ecosystems in a cost-effective manner.@@@Afforestation

Canopy openings range from small gaps, resulting from windthrow of single dominant trees, to occasional large gaps of many hectares formed by straight-line winds associated with severe thunderstorms and rare subtropical hurricanes. Vegetation regeneration response in small gaps and larger artificially created (i.e., timber harvested) gaps has been extensively studied, but little has been reported on naturally formed large gaps (> 6 trees) where a partial canopy typically remains from residual overstory and midstory trees. We investigated advance regeneration survivorship on a landscape scale within and around 12 large wind-felled gaps created by Hurricane Opal (October 1995) in a Southern Appalachian watershed. We hypothesized that survivorship would (1) change along a linear distance gradient from the unaffected forest towards gap center (2) vary in relation to categorical gap locations-within-gaps versus in the adjacent unaffected forest and (3) be affected by vegetation and environmental variables. In early 1996 we tagged tree seedlings in quadrats located along linear axes that extended from gap center into the unaffected forest and measured a variety of vegetation and environmental variables. Overall mean survivorship declined from 1997 (0.96) to 2016 (0.56). We found that survivorship was related to linear distance gradients for species rated intermediate in shade tolerance, such as red oaks, but not for shade intolerant, tolerant, and semi-tolerant species (e.g. white oaks). We found that survivorship increased on a linear distance gradient from gap center into the unaffected forest over the first 9 years of our investigation. By year 20 this relationship had reversed: survivorship increased from the unaffected forest to gap centers. Survivorship was also modeled as a function of categorical location of tagged seedlings within-gaps versus in the unaffected forest. Again, we found that survivorship of only intermediate shade tolerant species was related to categorical locations. Survivorship decreased in relation to time and cohort competition and increased with initial seedling height. Our 20-year investigation revealed changes in dynamics of regeneration that would not have been apparent in a short-term study. These results will enable resource managers to assess regeneration development in large gaps following windstorms in oak-dominated hardwood stands.@@@Canopy gap

There is however a lack of documentation on the amount of such damages, and the causal agents involved. In two separate studies in SE Norway, we assessed the frequency of multiple tops in young sapling-sized stands, and studied the relationship between the occurrence of multiple tops and lammas growth the previous growing season on the sample trees. Study 1 included 44 planted and 10 naturally regenerated stands, while Study 2 included 68 planted stands with information on seed source. Among sample trees with multiple tops, 57% (Study 1) and 32% (Study 2) had signs of lammas growth the previous autumn, either in the form of an extended leading shoot or swollen bud. Site index as well as sample tree height were positively correlated to the occurrence of both lammas growth and multiple tops in both studies. In Study 1 we show that the probability of lammas growth was significantly higher in planted than in naturally regenerated stands. In Study 2 we show that it was higher in stands planted with seedlings grown from stand-origin seeds compared with improved seed material. Furthermore, the results of both studies show that lammas growth occurs most frequently among the dominant trees in the stand.@@@Autumn bud flush

Forest abandonment is one of the main causes of forest degradation in Mediterranean areas where the low value-added of forest activities affects economic sustainability. This issue requires urgent restoration actions which must be supported by cost–benefit analysis that comprises all forestry activities that generate income, including the recreational ones. In effect, while the impact of forest management systems on timber production is well studied, the impact of recreational values is not. The present article intends to demonstrate that different forms of forest management result in a differing willingness to pay (WTP) for maintaining the recreational use of forests. We collected 248 questionnaires from respondents who confirmed their WTP for the maintenance of the recreational function of forests under three management systems: coppice, active conversion to high forest, and the natural evolution of forests. Moreover, we tested the influence of certain socio-demographic variables on individual WTP. Users elicited a high preference for conversion to high forest, while natural evolution was the least preferred management system. Moreover, males and users with higher levels of education had a greater WTP for conversion to the high forest approach.@@@Forest management

In this laboratory study, the use of four seed treatments to potentially reduce bank vole (Myodes glareolus) consumption of beech nuts and acorns and a control was evaluated using a no-choice feeding set-up. The five seed treatments were: Chili (Capsicum chinense)/coconut fat, citronella (Cymbopogon winterianus)/rapeseed oils, mink (Mustela vision) excrement, sand coating as a physical barrier and a control. Seed germination tests were carried out with all the treatments. A total of 40 bank voles were individually given access to beech nuts or acorns at a rate of one treatment per day during two sessions. Mink excrement and chili/coconut fat treatments greatly reduced the consumption of beech nuts, and also reduced touching of beech nuts and acorns. In contrast, the sand coating treatment increased the consumption of both types of seeds. Germination of both beech nuts and acorns was reduced by the chilli/coconut fat and citronella/rapeseed oils treatments. Our results suggest that mink excrement has a potential as an effective repellent against bank voles when direct seeding is applied. However, further studies to determine the best method of application, as well as the efficiency under field conditions, are needed before definitive recommendations can be given to restoration managers.@@@Broadleaved forests

They not only protect seedlings from browsing but also ameliorate microclimatic conditions, improving post-planting survival and growth. However, the ecophysiological basis of these effects are poorly understood. A factorial experiment combining light transmissivity and shelter type (solid tube vs. mesh wall) was carried out to assess the impact of contrasting microclimatic characteristics on seedling performance and physiological stress levels of shelters in two Mediterranean shrubland species (Quercus coccifera and Rhamnus lycioides) planted in a semiarid site. Even though seedlings in solid tube shelters experienced higher temperature and were slightly more photoinhibited, they had higher predawn water potential and, in general, better survival and growth than in mesh wall shelters. However, these effects were species-specific, with Rh. lycioides more favoured by solid wall shelters than Q. coccifera. However, root growth cannot explain these interactions between species and shelter type on seedling survival. Since light transmission had a marginal effect compared with wall type, we proposed that the observed effects and interaction with species are not dependent on light intensity or temperature but on other microclimatic differences like air velocity or light quality and distribution. Further studies should assess the importance of these factors on post-planting growth and physiological stress levels, which can be critical for matching the correct tree shelters type for each species in plantations in semiarid environments.@@@Afforestation

It has been proven to enhance the survival and early growth of seedlings. ContainerizedP. abies and P. sylvestris saplings were excavated 1–3 years after outplanting in clear cut forests across Latvia. The excavated saplings were grown in forests that had been prepared either using site mounding or disc trenching soil preparation method. The aim was to determine the effects of soil preparation method used on the root depth, dry mass and orientation. Saplings are forming deeper root system that expand evenly when planted on mounds, yet the root dry mass was not affected by soil preparation method or soil type.

Reclamation areas of open-pit mines provide a unique opportunity to study these relationships, as these sites are often homogeneous and have few ecological legacies. Our study evaluated the early performance of three boreal tree species planted at different densities over a large reclaimed landscape (57 ha) in northern Alberta, Canada, that varied in landscape topography, surface soils, and coarse woody material. A range of soil, topographical, and seedling characteristics were measured over five growing seasons. The two surface soils had stark differences in their physical and chemical properties. Overall, seedling survival was high (> 80%) for jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) and somewhat lower (60%) for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). All three species grew taller in the fine-textured than in the coarse-textured soils. Linear models identified simple relationships among some of the monitored variables. To further explore more complex relationships, we built a structural equation model for jack pine growth, 2 and 5 years after planting. On coarse-textured soil, the factors controlling pine growth shifted from intrinsic factors of seedling quality in the second growing season to more complex interactions in the fifth growing season, driven by soil nutrients, water availability and colonizing vegetation. We believe these models have the potential to be useful in forest reclamation, by identifying driving factors that could be monitored to indicate reclamation success.@@@Forest restoration

SOM enters mineral soil through leaching of dissolved organic matter from the forest floor; macrofaunal processing of above-ground litter and mixing with soil (bioturbation); and direct deposition of root litter and rhizodeposits. Our study focused on how SOM accumulation in reclaimed mineral soils was affected following re-vegetation with three vegetation treatments: deciduous trees (Populus tremuloides Mitchx. and Populus balsamifera L.), spruce trees (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) and grasses (Festuca sp., Bromus inermis), compared to the natural boreal forest. Seventeen sites were studied: 4 reclaimed Deciduous, 5 reclaimed Spruce, 4 reclaimed Grass, and 4 Natural forest. Concentrations of soil organic matter in the upper 30 cm of soil were highest at the Deciduous sites and lowest at Natural sites. SOM concentrations in the top 10 cm of soil were elevated relative to 10–30 cm soil at the Deciduous and Grass sites. The elevated SOM in the upper soil at Deciduous and Grass sites was associated with greater macrofauanal activity and higher root biomass at these sites. The higher macrofaunal activity in the surface organic layer and greater amounts of faunal fecal material in the uppermost cm of soil at Deciduous and Grass sites indicate greater enrichment of upper soil by macrofauna at these sites. SOM concentrations were significantly positively related to root abundance at Grass sites (indicating a contribution of roots to SOM), and a similar trend was apparent at the Deciduous sites. The elevated organic matter concentrations in the upper 10 cm of soil at the Deciduous and Grass sites suggest that planting of aspen following reclamation would hasten C sequestration into soil organic matter.@@@Picea

However, global forest cover continues to decline, and recent evidence suggests deforestation rates are accelerating. Against this background the area of planted forests has increased globally. Recognizing the substantial potential of well-managed forest plantations, the new generation plantations (NGP) platform was launched in 2007. NGP encourages well-managed planted forests in the right places to conserve biodiversity and meet human needs. Here we describe the NGP approach and analyze data and information from NGP participants and others over 10 years. This shows that NGP participants are responsible for c.11.1 million ha of land, much of it previously degraded or abandoned; 43% is managed as timber plantations, with the remainder being wildlife reserves, restored natural forest, grassland and agriculture. NGP case studies illustrate a range of biodiversity, conservation and socio-economic achievements. These achievements, considered together with future projections of timber demand and of the land available for restoration to tree cover, demonstrate the potential of well-managed plantations to protect natural forests, provide timber, conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change. The NGP concept works in a variety of countries and contexts; participants have shown that it is possible to produce timber while maintaining and enhancing ecosystems and contributing to socio-economic development.

Since ancient times they have provided important services to humans, and several selected genotypes have been massively propagated and planted. Today elm populations are severely degraded due to the negative impact of human-induced changes in riparian ecosystems and the emergence of the highly aggressive Dutch elm disease pathogens. Despite the death of most large elm specimens, there is no evidence of genetic diversity loss in elm populations, probably due to their ability to resprout after disease. The recovery of elm populations from the remaining diversity should build from genomic tools that facilitate achievement of resistant elm clones. Research works to date have discerned the genetic diversity of elms and are well on the way to deciphering the genetic clues of elm resistance and pathogen virulence, key findings for addressing recovery of elm populations. Several tolerant clones suitable for use in urban and landscape planting have been obtained through traditional species hybridization with Asian elms, and various native clones have been selected and used in pilot forest restoration projects. Successful reintroduction of elms should also rely on a deeper understanding of elm ecology, in particular their resilience to abiotic and biotic disturbances. However, all these efforts would be in vain without the final acceptance of elm reintroduction by the social actors involved, making it necessary to evaluate and publicize the ecosystem services elms can provide for today’s society.@@@Ulmus

I present four general principles to guide strategies aimed at meeting these challenges: (1) protect and restore populations of key species and their habitats, (2) conserve and restore key attributes of stand structural complexity, (3) maintain and restore natural patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and (4) maintain and restore key ecological processes. The complexity associated with these principles is that how they will be practically implemented on the ground will invariably be ecosystem specific as what constitutes stand structural complexity or landscape heterogeneity will vary between ecosystems. Here I demonstrate the practical application of the four general principles in a detailed case study of conservation and restoration in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. These forests are characterized by declining species, loss of key elements of stand structural, loss of old growth forest, altered patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and altered ecosystem processes. I highlight how altered management practices in Mountain Ash forests that are guided by our four general principles can help conserve existing biodiversity and underpin effective forest restoration. Consideration of our general principles also can identify policy deficiencies that need to be addressed to enhance restoration and biodiversity conservation.@@@Forest biodiversity conservation

It allows identifying and quantifying overall patterns and exploring causes of variation. The inclusion of published works in meta-analyses requires, however, a minimum quality standard of the reported data and information on the methodology used. Our experience with conducting a meta-analysis on the relationship between seedling quality and field performance is that nearly one third of the apparently relevant publications had to be discarded because essential data, usually statistical dispersion parameters, were not properly reported. In addition, we encountered substantial difficulty to explore the effect of covariates due to the poor description of nursery cultivation methods, plantation location, and management in a significant proportion of the selected primary studies. Thus, we present guidelines for improving methodology detail and data presentation so that future forest restoration-oriented research can be more readily incorporated into meta-analyses. In general, research studies should report data on means, sample size, and any measure of variation even if they are not statistically significant. The online availability of raw data is the best practice to facilitate the inclusion of primary research on meta-analyses. Providing full information about the production of nursery seedlings, such as plant material and experimental conditions, is essential to test whether these procedures might have an effect on seedling quality. In addition, detailed information about field trials such as site climate, soil preparation techniques, previous land use, or post-plantation management, is needed to elucidate whether seedling quality is context-dependent. Thus, we provide a detailed checklist of important information that should be included when reporting forest restoration research involving the use of nursery-produced seedlings. All this will help to quantitatively synthetize current state-of-knowledge and thus contribute to the advancement of the forest restoration discipline.@@@Data quality

Shade light regime 542 µmol m−2s−1 resulted in significantly greater stockplant height than in 160 and 2008 µmol m−2s−1. Significantly more useable cuttings were harvested from the tall plants under an irradiance of 542 µmol m−2s−1, fewer from 160 µmol m−2s−1, and the least from 2008 µmol m−2s−1. The rooting ability of cuttings was greatest from stockplants receiving 542 µmol m−2s−1 (> 60%) and least from those receiving 160 µmol m−2s−1 (20%). 45% of cutting rooted from stockplants under full sun (2008 µmol m−2s−1). The speed of rooting of cuttings followed the same ranking with the fastest rooting from plants receiving 542 µmol m−2s−1 (7.1 ± 1.04 weeks to reach 25% of rooting) and the slowest from those under 160 µmol m−2s−1 (12.3 ± 1.85 weeks to reach 25% of rooting). The results of this study demonstrate that the light management of A. floribunda stockplants is important for the maximization of the yielding of cutting and the speed of rooting of leafy stem cuttings. Tree plantation being a key option to alleviate environmental challenges that the world is facing today, these results confirm previous findings which postulates that appropriate light management in stockplants can increase the production speed of required seedlings.@@@Number of cuttings

This fruit is harvested mostly from natural forests, and limited advances have been made for cultivating it as a fruit tree. This study was aimed at assessing the effect of plantation spacing and seed source on early fruiting of stone pine plantations for pine nut production in Chile. We tested two plantation spacings (5 × 5 and 7 × 7 m) and three local seed sources (Tanumé, Cáhuil and Chillán), selected according to the current cultivation practices in Chile in a multi-environment trial involving four sites. Plantations were repeatedly measured annually for 6 years after establishment. High environmental effects as well as interactions between environment and management techniques were observed for all growth variables. Spacing had effects on crown development at all sites except for the most limiting one, but not on height or root-collar diameter. The lowest density (7 × 7 m) was associated with the highest crown diameter. Effects of seed source varied across environments, being significant for growth variables in both environments with poor growth. Young plantations (5 and 6 years old) showed a trend that suggests a higher precocity of entry into fruiting and higher strobili production for the 7 × 7 m than for 5 × 5 m spacing. Our results suggest that plantations can be effective for stone pine fruit production in Chile, and the convenience of developing environment-specific plantation designs, considering spacing as a relevant parameter for orchard establishment and management.@@@Initial cone production

However, the effects on Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) seedlings are less well known. In this study, short-day treatments were applied to container-grown Chinese pine seedlings by artificially reducing day length to 8 or 10 h for 3 weeks. Growth and physiological responses of the seedlings were evaluated. In addition, proteome analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis was performed on needles of the seedlings. Short-day treatments significantly affected seedling bud set, height, root collar diameter and number of first-order lateral roots (> 1 mm diameter at junction with taproot). Short-day treatments significantly enhanced the content of total chlorophyll, starch, abscisic acid, and lignin, and increased activity of phenylalanine ammonialyase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase, but did not differ in the content of soluble sugar. We positively identified eight differentially expressed proteins induced by short-day treatments: oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, transcription factor VOZ1, ferredoxin-NADP reductase, leaf isozyme 1, protein MET1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, elongation factor Tu, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase. These proteins are mainly involved in photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, as well as abiotic and biotic stress resistance. Our results suggest that short-day treatment is a way to produce high-quality Chinese pine seedlings in the nursery.@@@Short-day

There is a serious bottleneck in C. macrolepis conservation: its seed vigor is lost rapidly after harvesting. To explore the feasibility of ultra-dry storage of the seeds of this species, seeds were dehydrated to five different moisture contents (MCs, 1–5%), and stored at ambient temperature for 5 years. Seeds stored at 2.1% or 3.0% had higher percentage germination than those stored than the non-dehydrated seeds. Furthermore, we measured quantitative changes in metabolic products, namely endogenous hormones, soluble sugars and fatty acids, and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Among four endogenous hormones investigated, the concentration of the auxin indole-3-acetic acid was not significantly different at different MCs, while there was a negative relationship between percentage germination and both gibberellic acid and cytokinin zeatin riboside concentrations, and a positive relationship between abscisic acid concentration and percentage germination. Seeds with MCs of 2.1 or 3.0% contained higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, corresponding to lower concentrations of malondialdehyde. Compared with seeds at other MCs, higher concentrations of sucrose, glucose, trehalose (but not fructose) and unsaturated fatty acids were maintained in seeds at 2.1% and 3.0% MCs. Therefore, we suggest that levels of certain endogenous hormones, antioxidant enzymes, soluble sugars and unsaturated fatty acids may help stabilize longevity of seed at ultra-low seed moisture content. Storage of seed of C. macrolepis at 2–3% MC at room temperature may be a useful method for conserving germplasm of this species and in facilitating nursery operations.@@@Calocedrus macrolepis

Despite its major relevance for the forestry sector, knowledge about its radial growth at different height levels is scarce—it is unprecedented for trees subjected to crown thinning. The following questions were answered: (1) how many competitors should be removed to favour the radial growth of potential crop trees? and (2) how long does it take to detect enhanced growth rates along the stem and how long do the effects last? The research design included four thinning treatments where competitor trees were removed in different intensities starting at age 5 years. At age 30 years, 20 trees from each thinning treatment were selected, of which cross-sectional discs were taken at 1.3 m, 25, 50 and 75% of commercial height. The removal of one competitor tree per potential crop tree is not sufficient to increase radial growth immediately after thinning—two competitors need to be removed. Growth responses were detected immediately at the tree base (1.3 m), but took ~ 3 and ~ 8 years to be detectable at 25% (~ 8 m) and 50% (~ 15 m) of commercial height. Positive influences on growth rate following thinning take longer to be detectable upwards in the stem than at the trees base. However, once present, enhanced growth rates last longer at higher levels than at the tree base.@@@Loblolly pine

There was an inverse linear relationship between length of cold stratification (5/1 °C for 0–12 weeks) and cumulative germination percentages in all incubation temperatures (15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 °C). Acorns required 12 weeks of cold stratification to break dormancy. Gibberellic acid substituted for cold stratification; although, it was not as effective as 12 weeks cold stratification. At 16 weeks of cold stratification, 20% of acorns had germinated, and the remaining 80% of ungerminated acorns reached ≥ 97 ± 1% cumulative germination within 4 days in all incubation temperatures. Post-germination time to epicotyl emergence and to leaf flush was a function of temperature, and time decreased with increased temperatures. With light held constant (50 μmol m−2 s−1), seedlings accumulated greater biomass in temperatures > 20/10 °C. Q. pagoda acorns possess Type 2 nondeep physiological dormancy, and this allows for artificial manipulation of timing and duration of germination. Extending cold stratification 4 weeks beyond dormancy break (i.e., 16 weeks) yields more uniform germination across a range of temperatures. Epicotyl emergence, seedling development, and biomass accumulation may be regulated by manipulating growing temperature. In this study, the most uniform seedling cohort with the greatest total biomass was produced when acorns received 16 weeks of cold stratification, followed by transfer of germinants to 30/20 °C.@@@Oak regeneration

A quantitative understanding of biomass allocation patterns is crucial to quantifying ecosystem dynamics and might have many practical uses in silviculture. In this research, we investigated the allocation of the aboveground biomass to leaves, branches, and bole as well as leaf morphology, using 26 saplings of Alnus subcordata C. A. M., 26 of Carpinus betulus L., and 27 of Fagus orientalis L. within a wide gradient of light conditions. Saplings were harvested in August 2014 in temperate, mixed deciduous forests of northern Iran in three sites with similar topographic conditions. A linear mixed effect model was used to evaluate the effect of light and species. Moreover, we developed biomass allometric equations using nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression. Biomass allocation to different organs and all leaf morphological traits were different among species. Light affected biomass allocation to leaves as well as specific leaf area and the direction of the effect was different for each species. Branch and bole allocation, leaf area ratio, and leaf area index were not affected by light. The effect of the interaction between light and species was significant for leaf allocation, branch allocation and specific leaf area. Moreover, sapling size seems to be an important factor explaining the effect of light on biomass allocation. Deriving highly precise biomass equations was possible by just using diameter at breast height and height, and available light did not improve the precision of models.@@@Available light

We used linear and nonlinear models to predict the total height (h) and stem volume (v), based on data from forest inventories and stem measurements of standing trees. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the simple linear model is the most accurate to estimate the total height of young African mahogany trees in relation to different types of height–diameter models (linearized, nonlinear and those with transformed variables); (2) simple and double-entry stem volume models have the same precision in estimating the individual volume of young African mahogany trees. The results showed that the simple linear height–diameter model was most accurate to estimate the height of both African mahogany species. The age’s effect (young trees) and probably the predominantly monopodial development of the Khaya spp. trees sampled were discussed as the causes of the linear nature of the models that best described the height–diameter relationship. The stem volume equations for Khaya ivorensis and Khaya anthotheca were well adjusted. However, the double-entry Spurr’s model was more accurate than the other models for both species. Furthermore, for the Khaya ivorensis, the one-entry (diameter) Husch’s model generated similar stem volume estimates to Spurr’s model.@@@Khaya anthotheca

However, the vast number of indexes based on the use of the RGB image segmentation and the lack of references in the literature still hinder the widespread use of this technology. Thus, we conducted a study aiming to test the relationships between methods based on absorbance and reflectance, widely used for the estimation of chlorophyll contents and physiological status of trees, and ten indexes based on RGB component analysis. We used leaves of five tropical tree species, belonging to different botanical families. Leaf absorbance was measured using the handheld chlorophyll meter SPAD-502, reflectance was measured using a spectrometer and the RGB indices were obtained from digitalized images of the leaves using a flatbed scanner. Modified linear regression models including all five species were used to relate RGB indices to absorbance and reflectance indices. Data collected from leaves of seedlings of five tropical tree species indicated that digital image processing technology can be a useful and rapid nondestructive method for assessment of physiological status of tree seedlings at nursery stage. Among the RGB indexes tested in this study the R, 2R*(G − B)/(G + B) and 2G*(G − B)/(G + B) are the most promising for analysis the tropical seedlings physiological status and quality.@@@Leaf image analysis

In the southern highlands, however, forestry is dominated by Pinus taeda. The frost-tolerant Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden seems to be suitable for that area, but there are few case studies and very little information about managing eucalypt stands for multiple uses. Thinning and pruning are key silvicultural management practices for E. dunnii plantations that produce saw- and veneer-logs. With this study it was aimed to evaluate the use of crown thinning to produce large-diameter trees in Eucalyptus dunnii stands. At age 2 years, 200 potential crop trees (pct) per ha were selected, pruned, and released from competition in five different intensities: no thinning, three practice-oriented variants, and one extreme and early thinning. Experimental data was collected until the stands were 13 years old. The production of large-diameter log assortments (≥ 40 cm) was positively associated with thinning and was strongly dependent on the site quality. Optimal results occurred with initial densities of 1000 trees ha−1 associated with early and relatively aggressive thinning. However, the final selection of pct’s and their release from competitors should not take place before dominant trees can be efficiently recognized (h100 = 15 m). Following these recommendations, at age of 13 years, the production of 100 m3 ha−1 of big sized timber (> 40 cm) can be expected.@@@Forest management

These forests primarily form symbioses with ectomycorrhizal fungi, and inventory and conservation of this resource is desirable as one tool to promote forest recovery in the future. We reviewed work on 311 ectomycorrhizal fungal species from publications on macrofungal sporocarps in Inner Mongolia over the past 30 years. In Inner Mongolia, the dominant ectomycorrhizal families are Russulaceae, Boletaceae and Cortinariaceae, with Russula, Lactarius, and Cortinarius as dominant ectomycorrhizal genera. Distributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi varied regionally, with higher diversity in northeastern Inner Mongolia than in western Inner Mongolia. Yearly precipitation across the region varied from ~ 400 to 120 mm, and probably was a dominant factor in diversity, although host distributions, stand age, and variable survey effort across the region could also contribute. In addition to sporocarp surveys, 99 ectomycorrhizal morphotypes have been identified belowground; all these ectomycorrhizal fungi could potentially be used as edible fungi in developing the under-forest economy or be potential inocula in afforestation of semi-arid to arid areas within Inner Mongolia. Finally, preservation and identification of resources of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Inner Mongolia will be vital in expanding the use of diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in inoculation of afforestation efforts, especially the establishment of an evaluation system for ectomycorrhizal fungi as potential inocula are advised.@@@Ectomycorrhizal fungal resource

To rehabilitate a high-graded temperate mixedwood stand, in Quebec, Canada, we used a split–split-split plot design with three replicates to assess different seed-tree and strip cutting systems, in combination with scarification and planting. The experiment consisted of three regeneration cuts in main plots: 10 seed-trees/ha, 40 seed-trees/ha and a 40-m wide strip clearcut (0 seed-tree/ha) with 60 seed-trees/ha in leave strips, thereby resulting in four levels of tree retention, and all included understory brushing. We applied two types of scarification (patch scarification or disk-trenching) to subplots, two regeneration modes (natural regeneration or planting with white spruce [Picea glauca]) to sub-subplots and two mechanical release treatments (softwood or mixedwood production) to planted sub–sub-subplots. Density of seed-trees did not affect the natural regeneration dynamics after 5 years, but disk-trenching was more efficient for the establishment of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Few seed-trees of desirable white spruce were present and most died standing, confirming the importance of supplemental planting. Height growth of planted seedlings was 15% higher in the 0 and 10 (26–27 cm/year) than in the 40 and 60 (23 cm/year) seed-trees/ha treatments, and release doubled mean height growth (33.1 vs. 16.6 cm/year). Despite intensive site preparation, pre-established beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta) and mountain maple (Acer spicatum) were present at high densities in the regeneration stratum. Controlling this recalcitrant layer might be the greatest challenge for rehabilitating degraded stands of the mixedwood forest, especially since the use of herbicides is prohibited on Quebec’s public lands.@@@Seed-tree retention

The aim of this study was to fit a state and transition model (STM) to predict the stem volume of slash pine silvopastoral systems under different management strategies. Volume growth was modeled by using the dominant height and the Relative Density Index, which can be related to other density indices (such as the Height Factor) through a proportionality factor. This link between density indices is what makes it possible to develop the transition functions, which are used to predict post-thinning stem volume. The transitional functions were established through three different approaches. Although all of them are good predictors of the Relative Density Index pattern, the best results in volume prediction were obtained when fitting the Weibull model to predict the Relative Density Index as a response of the Height Factor. By using this transition function, the differences in the mean volume between the predicted and observed data were less than 7% for all cases. We conclude that the proposed models are valuable management tools to predict the stem volume accumulated in the post-thinning period, and therefore, this finding may improve the management planning of the plantations of the region.@@@Density indices

We investigated this question using provenance/progeny tests (12 provenances, 108 families) of Balanites aegyptiaca from semi-arid Niger. The nursery test included treatments for time (12–16 months) and watering regime (reduced and normal). Family variation was significant for shoot diameter (Sdia), height (Sht), dry weight (Swt) and root dry weight (Rwt) in the nursery, and for tree height at 1 and 2 years (Fht-1, Fht-2) but not at 13.5 years (Fht-13.5) in the field. Provenance variation was significant only for root/shoot weight ratio (RSwt) in the nursery. Family mean Fht-1 and Fht-2 were positively correlated with all nursery growth variables except RSwt. Provenance mean Fht-2 was positively correlated with Sht, while provenance mean Fht-13.5 was negatively correlated with Swt and positively correlated with RSwt. Family mean survival at 13.5 years was positively correlated with Swt, Sdia, Fht-1 and Fht-2. Family mean Rwt, RSwt and Fht-2 increased from the more humid western to the drier eastern locations. Most correlations with nursery growth variables were stronger at 16 than at 12 months and in the normal compared with the reduced watering regime. Results suggest that Swt and Sdia may be useful for predicting family survival in the field, and Rwt and RSwt may be useful for investigating geographic variation in growth in the field. We recommend conducting both nursery and long-term field tests.@@@Nursery root and shoot growth

Flueggea is a well-used local species and removal of the flueggea for personal use would effectively thin the entire stand over time. Stocking rates and tree species composition are two important factors affecting tree growth and yield when a mixed species plantation is established. This study aimed to investigate the effects of stocking rates on early teak growth in a mixed species system in a humid tropical region of Western Province, Solomon Islands. The experimental design included: teak planted as a monoculture at standard stocking of 833 stems per hectare (sph) (Treatment 1); teak planted in rows alternating with 2 rows of flueggea at 833 sph; 625 sph; and 416 sph (Treatments 2,3 and 4 respectively); and teak planted in alternating rows with a single row of flueggea at 833 sph (Treatment 5). Teak basal area was optimum at the lowest stocking rates of 412 and 625 sph for both species. However, teak yield (volume per hectare) was greater in the higher stocking rate treatments. Teak basal area mean annual increment (BA MAI) decreased in higher stocking rates between the age of 4 and 5 years indicating the onset of suppression and the need for progressive thinning. Under correct silvicultural maintenance, the 833 sph planting density offers the benefits of higher stocking and lower maintenance. As the present investigation was confined to the establishment phase for teak, more studies are needed to understand the system development to maturity.@@@Total height

A first-order autoregressive spatial mixed model was found to significantly improve the fit of the model, compared with the standard non-spatial mixed model approach, due to substantial spatial heterogeneity within sites. The average individual-tree narrow-sense heritability estimates based on this spatial analysis were 0.49 for diameter at breast height, 0.36 for total height, and 0.48 for volume, with stem straightness being low to moderate (average = 0.11). The additive genetic correlation estimates between growth traits were positive (0.51 ≤ \(\hat{r}_{a}\) ≤ 0.99) and statistically significant from zero. In contrast, the genetic correlations between growth traits and stem straightness although in general also positive were not significantly different from zero (− 0.22 ≤ \(\hat{r}_{a}\) ≤ 0.59). Age-to-age genetic correlations were consistently higher for growth traits (\(\hat{r}_{a}\) ≥ 0.81) than for stem straightness (\(\hat{r}_{a}\) ≥ 0.33). The average additive genetic correlation estimated between sites within test series was high for all traits evaluated (average > 0.72). In contrast, average additive genetic correlation estimated between sites across series was slightly lower (average < 0.63).

Here, we aimed to understand how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) affect the growth and drought tolerance of tree species used for afforestation, with the ultimate aim of using them to restore degraded karst ecosystems. A pot experiment was conducted in which Zenia insignis seedlings were inoculated separately with three AMF (Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizoglomus intraradices, and Diversispora versiformis) and a mixture of all three species under two water regimes (drought stress and normal water) in a greenhouse. The results showed that AMF have a positive effect on plant biomass, osmolytes, and antioxidant enzyme activity under drought conditions. Shoot/root biomass increased by 12.5–33.8% and plant height increased by 13.6–32.1% after inoculation with AMF under drought conditions. The phosphorus content of the shoots significantly increased in mycorrhized plants, whereas nitrogen content was minimally affected. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was higher under drought stress in mycorrhized plants than in non-mycorrhized plants. The same pattern was found for soluble sugar and proline content in mycorrhized seedings under water deficit conditions. Mixed AMF inoculation had a more beneficial effect on plant growth than single AMF inoculation. In conclusion, our results indicate that AMF inoculation could help restore degraded ecosystems in desertified karst regions.@@@Rocky desertification

Understory enrichment planting has been proposed as a means to reintroduce the species in managed stands in which regeneration is deficient. Here, we present 5-year results regarding survival and growth dynamics of red spruce seedlings planted under hardwood, mixedwood, and coniferous forest covers following various cuts (each made on 0.5–1.2 ha square area): hybrid single-tree and group-selection, irregular shelterwood (two variants: continuous cover and extended irregular shelterwood), uniform regular shelterwood, harvesting with advance regeneration protection (HARP), and careful logging around advanced growth (hereafter referred to as ‘patch clearcut’). Five-year seedling survival did not vary among cuts except under the coniferous cover, where it was better in the heavier cuts (HARP and patch clearcut; 67%) than under continuous cover shelterwood cuts (24%), in which browsing occurrence was high (around 80%). Under the hardwood cover, height, diameter and biomass growth were greater in the extended irregular shelterwood cut than in other treatments. Under the mixedwood and coniferous covers, seedling growth was greater in patch clearcut, likely because transmitted light (90–100% full sunlight) was higher than in other cuts (around 30%). Results suggest that red spruce could be reintroduced using enrichment planting under a partial forest cover, but that additional treatments could be necessary to manage light and to limit browsing pressure in order to optimize long-term survival and growth performance.@@@Browsing

"1040","The effect of tree planting density on the relative development of weeds and hybrid poplars on revegetated mine slopes vulnerable to erosion@@@@@@Received: 01 December 2017 Accepted: 24 August 2018 Published: 31 August 2018 Issue Date: 15 July 2019@@@In reclaimed waste rocks slopes, the soil cover spread for revegetation is prone to erosion. This soil needs to be immediately protected from soil erosion by above and belowground vegetation. The seeding of fast-growing herbaceous species used in agriculture is generally used on waste rock slopes to control erosion, but these compete with planted trees for resources needed for growth. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of an alternative to these herbaceous species (i.e. fast-growing hybrid poplars) to mitigate soil losses in the short-term. However, the growth of poplars could be impaired by competition from weeds’ colonization. Tree planting density was expected to change competition levels among trees and between trees and weeds, so influencing above and belowground vegetation development and hence effectiveness at controlling soil erosion processes. Five treatments were installed in 2013: 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 4 × 4 m spacing of hybrid poplars; 2 × 2 m spacing, with hydroseeding of fast-growing herbaceous plants; and a control plot with no tree planting or hydroseeding. The planting of hybrid poplars did not decrease soil losses compared to the control plot, regardless of the tree planting density. Weed development through natural colonization occurred in all the non-hydroseeded plots and was more effective at soil erosion control in the short-term than planted trees. The selected clone of hybrid poplar coped well with any competition from weeds for water, since 100% of trees survived after 3 years and since the non-hydroseeded plots produced greater length of roots per soil volume (root length density, RLD) for the poplars compared with the weed species. As early as the first year, the hydroseeded plots showed the highest RLD and a complete cover of vegetation which effectively controlled soil erosion compared to the control plots. However, both treatments with increased competition levels (i.e. highest tree planting density and hydroseeding treatment) showed less aboveground tree biomass. On the hydroseeded plots, where interspecific competition with weeds was the highest, a greater increase in root length was seen during the third year after planting. After 3 years, canopy closure was achieved in the 1 × 1 m spacing treatment, which reduced weed cover.@@@Erosion pin method

Applying grafting techniques helped produce quality planting materials with unique characters, as these techniques influenced union establishment and successful growth of the grafted plants. This study assessed effects of different grafting techniques on establishment and early growth of four African mahogany species (Khaya ivorensis, K. anthotheca, K. grandifoliola and K. senegalensis) using 2-year old seedling rootstocks and scions from mature trees with desirable stem form. We assessed effects of three grafting methods (top-cleft, side grafting, and whip and tongue), and scion type on growth performance of the African mahogany species at 6 months after grafting. K. grandifoliola scion grafted onto K. grandifoliola rootstock recorded highest mean graft success (81.67%), number of leaves formed (11.6) and shoot height growth (7.47 cm) in the top-cleft method. The whip and tongue method was least successful among the three methods. Homografted plants had greatest influence on the grafting parameters for highest mean successes in K. grandifoliola/K. grandifoliola (81.67%), K. anthotheca/K. anthotheca (73.33%) and K. senegalensis/K. senegalensis (63.33%) except K. ivorensis scion type which occurred in the heterograft K. grandifoliola/K. ivorensis (76.67%). Highest performance of the top-cleft method is attributed to good contact between cambia of the grafted species and thus their easy union and growth. Grafting of the four African mahogany species is most successful using top-cleft grafting technique for sustainable production of improved cultivars for restoration and conservation.@@@Grafting methods

In the present study, eight native species (Bauhinia pulchella, Bauhinia longipedicellata, Dioclea apurensis, Mimosa camporum, Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea, Mimosa pudica, Parkia platycephala, and Stryphnodendron pulcherrimum) from the metalliferous savannas (cangas) and forests of Carajás Mineral Province, eastern Amazon-Brazil, were studied to determine seed size, seed quality (X-ray and tetrazolium tests), germination, and dormancy break requirements (boiling water, acid and mechanical scarification), and seed storage behavior. Our results showed considerable variation in seed size and percentage germination among the species. There was a strong relationship between seed size and germination, and the germination was greater for larger seeds from forests than smaller seeds from canga. All three scarification methods increased germination of M. camporum and M. acutistipula var. ferrea. Seeds of D. apurensis, M. acutistipula var. ferrea, M. pudica, and P. platycephala did not show a significant decline in germination after storage, indicating possible orthodox behavior. In contrast, B. pulchella, B. longipedicellata, M. camporum, and S. pulcherrimum showed behavior typical of recalcitrant or intermediate seeds since the germination of these species was reduced after storage. Further studies addressing seed dormancy break and seed storage in other native species are encouraged for a better use of native species in mineland revegetation.@@@Seed properties

In this study, we evaluated the adaptation and growth, as well as G × E interactions, shown by white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) open-pollinated (OP) families across two adjacent breeding zones (i.e., the BZ3300 and BZ4300, respectively) in northwestern Ontario using progeny test data, including 80 OP families (40 from each) that were cross-tested between the breeding zones. Results showed that the OP families from the southerly BZ4300 breeding zone averaged higher survival and significantly greater mean tree height growth than the local OP families in the more northern BZ3300 breeding zone at tree age of 14 years, with no notable difference in frost damage. Estimates of type-B genetic correlation from pairwise tests or combined-test analyses were almost all greater than 0.7, suggesting weak G × E interactions. Greater variation among families and higher heritability estimates in tree height were observed for families from the BZ3300 breeding zone or when families from the two breeding zones were combined. The weak G × E interactions, in addition to better survival and growth of the southerly families in the more northern breeding zone, suggested benefits from deploying seed from current seed orchard in the BZ4300 breeding zone to the BZ3300 breeding zone and merging the two breeding zones when starting the second generation breeding to increase tree improvement efficiency and likely higher genetic gain under future climate.@@@Tree improvement

Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated their variability responses to fertilizer treatments at inter-annual, inter-tree and stand-production levels. Therefore, the annual ring width (RW) and density (RD) of sixty 17-year-old-Pinus taeda trees fertilized with six doses of composted pulp-mill sludge (CPMS) were analyzed. Ten trees for each treatment were felled and from which wood discs were taken at different trunk heights. The annual RW and RD were provided by X-ray microdensitometry, synchronized and the trunk basic specific gravity (SGB) and biomass calculated. The effects of CPMS treatments were explored using interaction of variables RW and RD with cambial age, diameter, trunk SGB and biomass production. Trees treated with CPMS grow faster, increasing their biomass (up to 108%), presenting lower wood density values (significant up to the 6th year) and reaching the mature wood later than untreated trees. Furthermore, the potential use of RW and RD in allometric equations showed good accuracy to predict trunk SGB and biomass. Altogether, our results indicated that ring width and density revealed the impacts of fertilization treatment on wood quality and production. Our study also provides useful information for forest managers on the fertilization monitoring process.@@@Allometric equation

Mutational witches’ broom is a major source for the majority of ornamental dwarf conifer cultivars with abundant branching. Pinus sibirica is also capable of forming mutational witches’ brooms. The species has valuable edible seeds, and therefore, dwarf cultivars with abundant cone-bearing could be used to establish cone crop plantations. To reveal how the mutation causing witches’ broom affects the quality of cones and seeds, we carried out a comparative analysis of cone size, cone structure and seed quality in six grafted clones with witches’ broom and normal clones from the same trees, determining seed losses at the different developmental stages. Cones from mutant clones had 1.5–2.9 times smaller size than normal clones. Cones from 50% of the normal clones were more elongated in shape. In mutant clones, the numbers of fertile scales and ovules were 1.4 times lower than in normal clones. Seeds had a smaller size in all mutant clones, and seed quality and seed efficiency were lower in two-thirds of the clones compared with normal clones. Seed losses were observed at different developmental stages, but there were significantly more losses before pollination and during embryo development in mutants. Therefore, the majority of mutants had small cones and therefore a rather ornamental value because of reduced seed efficiency and small seeds. At the same time, individual mutant clones had a seed efficiency and the number of filled seeds close to those of normal clones. They could therefore be promising as cone-bearing cultivars for the commercial production of pine kernel.@@@Witches’ broom

Stockings at planting varying from 2000 to 1111 trees ha−1 were thinned from 1333 to 450 trees ha−1 (representing 27–54% thinning %) at ages 2.0–5.6 years. Tree diameter (DBH) responses to thinning were greater in the south than in the north and south central regions. Application of fertiliser at thinning increased DBH and stand volume (SV), compared with the unfertilised treatment, regardless of thinning treatment. Early thinning (at age 2–3.6 years) to 450 or 600 trees ha−1 resulted in the greatest DBH for all diameter classes with a greater proportion of larger diameter logs. The 3-PG process-based model was applied to predict DBH and SV for all silvicultural treatments and ages. When thinning is conducted at 2–3.6 years after planting, the modelling showed that for medium and large-diameter sawlogs, the optimum rotation length is at least 5–7 years in the south and south central coast and 6–10 years in northern Vietnam.@@@Acacias

"1047","Trembling aspen root suckering and stump sprouting response to above ground disturbance on a reclaimed boreal oil sands site in Alberta, Canada@@@@@@Received: 28 September 2018 Accepted: 15 December 2018 Published: 01 January 2019 Issue Date: 15 September 2019@@@Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is an important early successional species in the boreal region that commonly regenerates via root suckering and, to a lesser extent, stump sprouting after aboveground disturbance such as harvesting or wildfire. However, the response of aspen to disturbance on reclaimed oil sands sites is not known. To determine the suckering and sprouting response of 6-year-old seedling origin aspen growing on a reclamation site, we destructively sampled 87 individual trees in May 2017. Trees were selected across two soil types, forest floor-mineral mix and peat-mineral mix, and three height classes, 100–199 cm, 200–299 cm, and > 300 cm. In August 2017, we returned to each cut tree to assess the type (sucker vs. stump sprout) and abundance of regeneration. Aspen readily responded to disturbance; however, responses were highly variable between trees, ranging from zero to 47 suckers and zero to 42 sprouts. Trees growing on peat-mineral mix were 7.8 times more likely to produce at least one sucker and generally had a higher abundance of suckers. Tree height was also positively correlated with suckering probability and abundance, while competition from surrounding vegetation decreased the probability and abundance of suckering, especially when cover of competing species was greater than 52.5%. The probability of stump sprouting was not affected by soil type or tree size, but did decrease with increases in tree competition. Overall, trembling aspen respond vigorously to disturbances on mine reclamation sites which is a promising sign of resilience for these novel and young ecosystems.@@@Populus tremuloides

Here, we discuss the combined effect of deposition of N forms on plant growth in low-phosphorus (P) soil and analyze the patterns that trees utilize to adapt to specific N forms in low-P and high-P soils. One-year-old Schima superba and Pinus massoniana seedlings grown in soil with 1.1 mg kg−1 available P (low-P) and 25 mg kg−1 available P (high-P) were treated with NaNO3 or NH4Cl solutions: N0 = 0 (control), N80 = 80 kg N ha−1 year−1, and N200 = 200 kg N ha−1 year−1. Soil N, P, seedling traits,and leaf N and P contents were measured. Leaf N/P ratios were calculated to determine plant nutrient status. Pinus massoniana had a larger suitable P range and thus showed better growth in low-P soil than S. superba. Although S. superba preferred NH4+ compared with P. massoniana, the addition of NH4+ aggravated the plant growth disadvantage in low-P soil, and high concentrations resulted in the death of P. massoniana plants. The moderate addition of NO3− promoted the growth of the two species. However, the addition of a high dose of NO3− inhibited P. massoniana growth in both low-P and high-P soil. The addition of NH4+-N and NO3−-N resulted in an increase and decrease in the leaf N/P ratios and made plants prone to P and N limitation, respectively. The addition of NH4+ and NO3−-N resulted in different species responses. The responses of tree species to N deposition may vary depending on the forms and rates of N deposition, and species-dependent N-requirements, which in turn are based on the species-specific P-requirements and soil P content. We conclude that plant biomass is related to soil NH4+/NO3− ratios in high-P soil.@@@NH4+-N

Numerous studies have previously documented aboveground biomass, C, and nutrient contents in loblolly pine plantations; however, similar data have not been collected on mined lands. We investigated C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg aboveground contents for first-rotation loblolly pine growing on reclaimed mined lands in the Gulf Coastal Plain over a 32-year chronosequence and correlated elemental rates to stand age, stem growth, and similar data for unmined lands. At the individual tree level, we evaluated elemental contents in aboveground biomass components using tree size, age, and site index as predictor variables. At the stand-level, we then scaled individual tree C and nutrients and fit a model to determine the sensitivity of aboveground elemental contents to stand age and site index. Our data suggest that aboveground C and nutrients in loblolly pine on mined lands exceed or follow similar trends to data for unmined pine plantations derived from the literature. Diameter and height were the best predictors of individual tree stem C and nutrient contents (R ≥ 0.9473 and 0.9280, respectively) followed by stand age (R ≥ 0.8660). Foliage produced weaker relationships across all predictor variables compared to stem, though still significant (P ≤ 0.05). The model for estimating stand-level C and nutrients using stand age provided a good fit, indicating that contents aggrade over time predictably. Results of this study show successful modelling of reclaimed loblolly pine aboveground C and nutrients, and suggest elemental cycling is comparable to unmined lands, thus providing applicability of our model to related systems.@@@Aboveground carbon

Our objective was therefore to assess the effect of individual and conjunct omissions of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, and Cu on the growth of a highly productive Eucalyptus urophylla × E. grandis hybrid clone, managed for coppicing at the second rotation, in two soils of contrasting fertility in southeastern Brazil. Two commercial sites of approximately 7 years of age, one in an Arenosol and the other in a Ferralsol, were harvested and the experiments installed. At the Arenosol site, the yield from the fertilizer treatment in the coppice system (R2) was the same as determined for the first rotation (high forest; R1), at approximately 40 m3 ha−1 year−1 at 6 years old. In contrast, the yield from the fertilizer treatment in R2 at the Ferralsol site was 11% lower compared with R1. Despite some alterations in leaf nutrient concentrations, other than for K at the Arenosol site (where the K omission treatment reduced wood volume at 6 years by 21%), no yield reduction was found for any no-fertilizer treatments. Due to the widely distributed root system already established in coppiced plantations, ensuring a large volume of soil exploration, coppiced eucalypts only responded to K application. This is due to low soil K availability and the high K demand in eucalypt plantations.@@@Fertilizer application

To understand appropriate planting conditions, it is necessary to characterize species-specific ecological traits such as photosynthesis and drought tolerance among Aquilaria species. To this end, we measured leaf morphological and photosynthetic traits among three Aquilaria seedlings (A. hirta, A. malaccensis, A. subintegra) in Malaysia. We also monitored changes in growth and survival in a shaded nursery and 7 and 18 months after transfer to open conditions. To avoid transplant stress, the seedlings were kept in polybags. The highest leaf cuticle and epidermis layer ratio, leaf mass per area, and long-term water use efficiency indicated by δ13C were recorded in A. hirta, suggesting that this species had relatively high drought tolerance. By contrast, the high maximum photosynthetic rate and high stomatal conductance observed in A. subintegra explained their high growth rate, although their drought tolerance was the lowest among the studied species. A. malaccensis was considered an intermediate species in terms of photosynthesis and drought tolerance. Interspecific differences in growth and survival were present after transfer to open conditions. A. hirta had the lowest growth rate and highest survival rate (50% survival after 18 months), whereas A. subintegra had the highest growth rate and lowest survival rate (9% survival after 18 months). A. malaccensis was intermediate between the two. In summary, the studied Aquilaria species were susceptible to stress under the open and dry conditions of our study. This includes Aquilaria hirta, the most drought-tolerant species in this group, and A. subintegra, the most vulnerable species to drought, which may require careful management when planted in open conditions.@@@Agarwood

The selection of appropriate growth media is crucial. Biochar, the product of pyrolysis of organic matter, has been suggested as a new organic amendment for soil or for soilless growth media. Biochar is usually strongly alkaline. We studied the possibility of acidifying biochar with nitric and phosphoric acids. The effects of raw and acidified biochars in peat-based substrates on rooting and growth of cuttings of Rosmarinus officinalis and in sandy soil-based substrates on growth of Phillyrea angustifolia seedlings were compared. The physical and chemical characteristics of the growth media, and the growth and nutrient content of seedlings were analysed. Results showed that biochar acidification with nitric and phosphoric acids improves the pH and enriches the biochar with N and P without excessively increasing electrical conductivity. However, a column experiment showed that nitrate was readily leached whilst phosphate was tightly retained by biochar, which questioned the practical availability of these nutrients to plants. The agronomical assays showed that both raw biochar and acidified biochar improved rooting and growth of Rosmarinus cuttings. In Phillyrea, however, the acidified biochar did not affect plant growth whilst the raw biochar gave satisfactory results both for shoot and root growth. Results led to the conclusion that biochar without further treatment might be successfully used as growth medium constituent, even at large proportions, both in organic and in mineral substrates.@@@Natural park nursery

The objective of this study was to estimate aboveground carbon storage and the impact of forest harvesting based on measurements of cut stumps in pine forests within the Área de Protección de Flora y Fauna Nevado de Toluca (APFFNT) in the state of México. A total of 1621 circular 0.1-ha sampling plots were established in a 12,924 ha pine forest (1.25% sampling intensity). Biomass was calculated using conventional volumetric equations incorporating species-specific wood densities. Aboveground carbon storage in the biomass was stratified by forest type including dense forest (≥ 336 trees), semi-dense forest (< 335 and > 150 trees), fragmented forest (< 150 and > 20 trees), and stands with isolated trees (< 20 trees). In the 12, 924 ha of forest dominated by Pinus hartwegii, 1,695,004 MgC was contained in aboveground biomass. Data on forest harvesting obtained by analysis of recent cut stumps allowed for the estimation of the removal of 42,701 MgC. In addition, we accounted for carbon in wind thrown trees of 14,904 MgC, some of which were removed over time in harvests. Total loss of carbon from the forest corresponded to 211,218 MgCO2 per year. In the APFFNT, forests dominated by pine with high biomass (P. hartwegii and P. montezumae) are being replaced by those with lower biomass (Alnus jorullensis). Changes in these communities will result in lower carbon capture in the APFFNT.@@@Biomass

Our objective was to evaluate genetic variation in reproductive phenology of Pinus patula clones in a seed orchard and the amount of overlap with pollen dispersal in natural stands. In 2014 and 2015, phenology of female and male strobili was recorded on 31 clones in the orchard, and phenology of male strobili was measured on 10 trees in each of four nearby natural stands along an elevational transect. Onset and end dates, and length of female receptivity (F_onset, F_end and F_length) and pollen dispersal (M_onset, M_end and M_length) were calculated, and genetic parameters were estimated. Differences between years in M_onset were larger in the natural stands than in the orchard, but there was a large overlap between the orchard and natural stands. A negative linear relationship with elevation was found for M_end and M_length in natural stands along the elevation transect. Genetic variation was detected for most reproductive phenology traits in the orchard. Genetic control was stronger for M_onset and M_length (\(H_{c}^{2}\) ≥ 0.54) than for female receptivity traits (\(H_{c}^{2}\) ≤ 0.38). Most phenological traits showed high genetic stability in both years (rB ≥ 0.76). We found a positive genetic correlation (r = 0.67) between F_onset and M_onset, suggesting there is a risk of selfing among clonal ramets. Moreover, the overlap between female receptivity in the orchard and pollen dispersal in neighboring natural stands indicates a risk of genetic contamination in the orchard, particularly for late-phenology clones.@@@Reproductive phenology

The aims of the study were to conduct a comparative study of old-growth and regrowth forests in terms of structure, woody species diversity and composition as well as to investigate the potential role of regrowth forests in the conservation and restoration of degraded forest lands in Laos and the tropics in general. Systematic plot sampling was used to survey the floristic diversity, species composition and structure of old-growth and regrowth forests. Concentric circular plots with an area of 200 m2 and 500 m2 were laid on line transects. A total of 24 plots were sampled from two sites. In comparison to regrowth forests, old-growth forests had higher structural heterogeneity because of higher canopy height variations, vertical stratification, and tree sizes and their variations. Species richness and diversity indices values were similar, but abundance and species composition were significantly different between old-growth and regrowth forests. It appears that species richness recovers first followed by forest structure and species composition. Regrowth forests are important for in situ conservation of tropical biodiversity and they can also serve as a conduit for the restoration of degraded lands and forests. Regrowth forests provide habitats, serve as buffer zones around the fragmented old-growth forests, function as source of propagules, and enhance landscape connectivity. Utilization of regrowth forests for restoration purposes is comparatively inexpensive. Regrowth forests should be given the due considerations in the national forest conservation and restoration policy of Laos.@@@Biodiversity

In turn, dispersal agents are affected by landscape composition and configuration. Understanding the effects of anthropization on pollen and seed dispersal in natural environments is crucial to developing long-term strategies for in situ and ex situ conservation of Neotropical savanna tree species. Here, we evaluated the genotypic and genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure (SGS), and pollen and seed dispersal of the endangered tree species Hymenaea stigonocarpa in a 2200-ha plot established in a strongly fragmented savanna landscape in Brazil. A total of 157 individuals were identified, 66 juveniles and 91 adults. Height, root-collar diameter for juveniles and diameter at breast height for adults were determined for each individual, and leaves were sampled to be used in genotyping by microsatellites. Genotypic diversity (\(R\)) was similarly high in adults (0.87) and juveniles (0.80), indicating more sexual reproduction than clonal. Heterozygosities were also similar between both generations, and no inbreeding was detected. Adults and juveniles present SGS, but the extent measured by the \(Sp\)-statistic was not significant. Both pollen and seed flow were elevated (24.2%) and reached long distances (3778 m and 3914 m, respectively) within the sampled area, but the pattern was not fat-tailed, indicating that most dispersal was over shorter distances. We conclude that fragmentation does not reproductively isolate the sampled population because individuals located outside the area may serve as sources of gene flow between remnant forest patches; however, the probability of dispersal over long distances is reduced.@@@Cerrado

This study examined the combined effect of woody ash and nitrogen (N) fertilization on the productivity, net C balance (NECB) and soil C sink capacity of a poplar SRC plantation established on a former arable land in northern Italy. Above- (ANPP) and below-ground (BNPP) primary productivity, including both root litter and rhizodeposition (Croot litter), were estimated by a combination of inventory methods, soil respiration measurements and C budgeting approaches. NECB was estimated as changes in both plant and soil C pools, and the portion of soil organic carbon (SOC) derived from poplar leaf and root litter was estimated using a combination of in-growth cores and isotopic measurements. Nitrogen application at 100 kg ha−1 increased ANPP in terms of C accumulation only in the first year, while NECB was not affected by treatments and was 9.96 Mg C ha−1 year−1 on average. Irrespective of the treatment, the plantation accumulated on average 0.7 Mg C ha−1 year−1 of SOC and the poplar-derived soil C input was 3.0 Mg ha−1 year−1. Positive NECB shows that the studied SRC resulted in an important C sink even in the first years after the establishment. However, long-term studies are needed to better assess the effect of N and ash application on C and nutrient cycles over more than one rotation period.@@@Poplar

In this research, we focused on South China’s timber investments, collected data from the Pingxiang, Guangxi Province, China, which is the demonstration zone of Fast-growing and High-yielding Timber Plantation Base Construction Program and National Timber Strategic Storage and Production Bases Construction Program, and used capital budgeting analysis method and sensitivity analysis to compare different scenarios of planted forest management. The results showed that excluding land costs, (1) the financial returns of Eucalyptus forest managed by small business were excellent, having an IRR of 28% per year and a LEV of $7555 per ha, but it had a high risk with fluctuations of cost, timber price and timber yield; (2) the results for the Experimental Center of Tropical Forests indicate that the Eucalyptus forest and Castanopsis hystrix forest returns were greater than those for Cunninghamia lanceolata forest and Pinus massoniana forest, with having IRRs of 24%, 21%, 13% and 10% per year respectively. The mixed planted forest of Castanopsis hystrix × Eucalyptus and Castanopsis hystrix × Pinus massoniana had the features of high profits and low risks; (3) the forest farmers had lower levels of returns for Eucalyptus forest management in South China, but were still in the middle rank of global comparisons. This study gave a view of China’s timber investment and provided more options of improving the economic returns of planted forest management to both small businesses and forest farmers in South China.@@@China

It allows the recovery of soil fertility for subsequent crops. However, the diminishing of fallow intervals (referred here as intensification of SA) is a main cause of forest degradation. Agroforestry systems (AFSs) based on modification of mature forests may play an important role in buffering adverse environmental outcomes caused by short fallow intervals in SA. We investigated whether AFSs reverse the effect of intensification of SA in cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agrosystems and aimed to (1) characterize species diversity in cocoa agroecosystem under SA with short fallow periods; (2) predict the ecological impact of intensification of SA on floristic composition, particularly in endangered endemic species; and (3) identify whether changes in floristic composition and species diversity in agroecosystems under different fallow intervals are localized in certain strata or whether structural changes occur throughout the plant community. Our study revealed that shortened SA’s fallow periods on cocoa AFSs have drastic effects on levels of diversity. Tree species assembly decreases across cocoa agroforest established in reduced fallow periods. Also, absence of fallow intervals of SA affects tree conservation rates in AFSs by changing floristic composition. Nevertheless, the use of AFSs with complex arboreal structures under SA preserves and protects higher rates of native and endangered endemic species and delays forest degradation rates. The conservation of native species in this agricultural model may meet the requirements to reverse the cycle of land degradation and social deprivation.@@@Agroforestry systems

With this study, we evaluate if differences in growth performance of different species mixtures in a tropical tree plantation can be attributed to the plasticity of the specific leaf area index. We compare the specific leaf area of five native Panamanian tree species growing in monospecific stands, stands containing two or three tree species and stands containing all five tree species. We could confirm the commonly observed interspecific linear relationship between leaf dry mass per leaf area. Despite the general relationship, a plasticity of the specific leaf area was detected for certain species in different mixture types. In general, the plasticity was lower for sun leaves than for shade leaves and the expression of leaf trait plasticity depended largely on the species. We performed an additive partitioning of mixture effects and the analysis resulted in strong complementarity effects on plot level. We speculate that leaf plasticity might increase the ability of certain tree species to use light more efficiently in mixed species stands. The resulting complementarity between species allows mixed stands an optimized light resource use and higher productivity. Accordingly, relative growth rate on plot level scaled linearly with specific leaf area of a given stand. Establishing mixed reforestation stands covering a wider range of tree leaf functional traits, such as assembling tree species characterized by different specific leaf area, might favor the expression of the trait plasticity and thus the overall plantation performance.@@@Leaf traits

The effect of water availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, competition, and soil chemical properties on young trembling aspen and white spruce height across two soil types (peat-mineral mix and forest floor-mineral mix) and two fertilizer levels (200 kg NPK ha−1 and no fertilizer) was examined. For comparison, we also studied a natural site that burned the same year the reclaimed site was established. On the reclaimed site, peat-mineral soil had the greatest tree height for both species, though not by a significant margin in the case of white spruce. The fertilizer treatment had no apparent effect on tree height on the forest floor-mineral soil and a negative effect on the peat-mineral soil. Fertilization increased vegetation cover on both soil types, which, when combined with the negative or lack of durable effect of fertilization on tree height, suggest that the increase in competition for resources could have had a stronger effect on tree height than the increase in immediately available nutrients following fertilization. The majority of tree height growth drivers found were related to nutrient availability and, as far as we can tell, did not significantly differ between reclamation soil types. Aspen sucker height on the burned site was not strongly correlated to the measured variables, suggesting that suckers do not yet fully rely on their environment for height growth.@@@Land reclamation

Coupled with effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition this could result in an overall decrease in survival and growth. In order to improve our understanding of the key limiting factors affecting trembling aspen we investigated survival probability and tree growth using data from an extensive network of permanent sample plots in Alberta (Canada). We developed mixed-effect non-linear models which included: tree size, competition, climate, pest incidence and time elapsed between consecutive measurements as predictor variables. Tree data from 1144 Permanent Sample Plots representing 39,394 trees for a total of 52,522 growth interval observations were used to develop these models. Annual data on aspen defoliation were available for the period 1990–2010, and the average Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was calculated for each measured interval by location. Intraspecific competition and competition from conifer species (i.e. spruce/fir and pine), had a strong negative effect on survival and growth. Aspen defoliators such as the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.), the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) and the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) had a negative impact on survival, but a strong positive effect on growth of surviving trembling aspen (i.e. compensatory growth). Increasing levels of CMI, which are associated with relatively cooler and wetter conditions, had a positive effect on survival and growth. Model validation results indicated good performance for survival and tree growth predictions. This study indicates that trembling aspen is very sensitive to competition, insect damage, and climate (i.e. drought); respectively, and this behavior will likely intensify as climate warms. The models developed in this study enhance our understanding of trembling aspen survival and growth in boreal North America and could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models.@@@Aspen defoliators

Ruil’s fragile state of conservation urges development of restoration programs, but specific protocols for nursery production and field establishment that ensure plant survival are largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect on nitrogen (N) fertilization and container size during nursery production in combination with the use of mesh shelters after outplanting on survival and growth during the first growing season in the field. First year outplanting survival of nursery-grown container seedlings was enhanced when seedlings were given nitrogen (N) during nursery production and deployed with mesh tree shelters in the field. The volume of the container had no effect on outplanting survival and growth. Increasing N from zero to 200 mg N L−1 provided sufficient N levels, resulting in increased seedling height, root-collar diameter, shoot biomass, and total seedling N and phosphorous concentrations. Additional N provided by the 400 and 600 mg N L−1 treatments underwent luxury consumption by the seedlings with no further benefits in field performance. Improved growth in the nursery, along with the use of mesh tree shelters after outplanting, especially during the typical summer drought, may be responsible for increased survival during the first growing season. Increasing the performance of nursery-grown ruil seedlings is essential to restoring this endangered, vulnerable, and foundation species within the highly biodiverse, yet seriously threatened endemic Maulino Costero Forest of the Mediterranean climate of central Chile.@@@Container volume

This study was aimed at determining whether or not propagation techniques affect cell wall composition and vascular traits in the wood of hybrid poplar. Clonally micropropagated plants and plants propagated from root cuttings were derived from mature hybrid poplar trees T-14 [Populus tremula L. × (Populus × canescens (Ait.) Sm.)] which were more than 30 years of age. Measurements were taken from both the vegetative plant origins following the seventh growing season after being planted in the field. These measurements included the content of main cell wall components and extractives, lignin monomer composition, neutral saccharide composition, macromolecular traits of both dioxane lignin and cellulose, and vascular traits. The micropropagated plants achieved significantly higher values for the content of cellulose, relative proportions of both d-glucose and d-mannose, and also for the weight-average molecular weight of dioxane lignin. The performance of the plants propagated from root cuttings was higher for traits primarily associated with the content of hemicelluloses, total yield of neutral saccharides, and for both absolute yields and relative proportions of d-xylose and l-arabinose. Similarities between both plant origins were found among the majority of the examined wood traits including the macromolecular traits of cellulose, lignin monomer composition and the vascular traits. Both plant origins formed compact homogeneous clusters clearly separated from each other in the multivariate wood trait analysis. There were no substantial drawbacks found in either the chemical profiles of the wood components or in the anatomical profiles of the vascular traits which could be attributed to the micropropagated plants of fast growing hybrid poplar. Seen from a practical viewpoint, hybrid poplar breeding programs could benefit from the compositional advantage of a higher cellulose content found in the micropropagated plants.@@@Cellulose

We tested the hypothesis that this distribution is partly due to increased soil water content and/or protection from winds in ravines as compared to ridges. We planted 396 saplings of the dominant tree species in a three-factor experiment that included topography (ridge/ravine), wind protection (protected/unprotected) and water addition (watered/not watered). We monitored wind speed and soil water content for one complete annual cycle and sapling survival and growth for 27 months. Sapling survival presented marginally significant differences for topography, being slightly greater in ridges than in ravines (0.88 and 0.78, respectively), with no significant differences for wind protection or water addition treatments. By contrast, sapling growth was considerably reduced in ridges as compared to ravines (16.1 and 26.0 cm, respectively); the wind protection treatment showed a significant positive effect on growth (saplings grew 25.5 and 16.5 cm with and without wind protection, respectively), whereas the water addition treatment had no effect. Importantly, saplings under wind protection treatment in ridges had similar growth to that of unprotected saplings in ravines, and growth difference due to the wind protection treatment was positively correlated with wind intensity, suggesting that reduced wind impact in ravines is an important abiotic factor that promotes forest occurrence in ravines.@@@Woodland

However, there is increasing interest in using it for solid-wood products. We studied the genetic architecture of key pulpwood and solid-wood selection traits using two E. globulus progeny trials in a high rainfall area (wet) of Tasmania and a previously studied trial in a low rainfall area (dry). These trials were established using open-pollinated families from native trees sampled from 13 subraces. We assessed traits in common [diameter at breast height (DBH) and wood basic density (BD)], and specific to pulpwood [Kraft pulp yield (KPY)] and solid-wood [stem straightness and acoustic wave velocity (AWV)] breeding. Significant genetic variation was found for all traits. Strong GxE was detected for DBH across the wet and dry sites, but little for BD and KPY. At the wet sites we show a positive genetic correlation between DBH and KPY, but not between DBH and BD. Subrace and family within subrace correlations between KPY and BD were significant but in opposite directions. We confirm previous reports of significant positive genetic and phenotypic correlations between KPY and AWV. A positive genetic correlation between stem straightness and DBH was detected, and subraces with straighter stems tended to have higher KPY. In general, correlations between most solid-wood and pulpwood traits were favourable, suggesting that past selection for pulpwood traits had neutral or favourable effects on many key solid-wood traits. We conclude that breeding for solid-wood and pulpwood are relatively compatible.@@@Eucalyptus globulus

However, the effects of timing on both the success and practicability of direct seeding has received little attention. Therefore, this study determined the effect of seed sowing time on direct seeding efficiency in terms of yield (number of established seedlings per 10 seeds sown) and seedling growth. We tested the hypothesis that seeds, stored and sown at the start of the rainy season, have higher and more rapid germination and that the resultant seedlings perform better, compared with those sown immediately after seed collection. Seeds of 17 native tree species, typical of seasonally-dry, upland, evergreen forest, were collected. Triplicates (50 seeds per replicate) were sown directly into degraded land, shortly after collection and compared with the same for stored seeds, sown at the start of the rainy season. Control seed batches were also germinated in a nursery for comparison. Seed germination was recorded weekly and growth and survival of resultant seedlings were recorded periodically. Our results did not support the above hypothesis. Differences in mean yield (number of seedlings established per 100 seeds sown) and growth between the two sowing times were not significant. Germination percentage and median length of dormancy (MLD) did not differ significantly between the sowing times, except for Artocarpus lacucha and Horsfieldia amygdalina, whose seeds germinated better immediately after seed collection than after storage (p < 0.01). Storage shortened median length of dormancy of Hovenia dulcis, Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica, Prunus cerasoides and Spondias pinnata seeds (p < 0.01). Seedling growth of a few species rivalled reported values of planted saplings (P. cerasoides, M. azedarach and B. variegata), regardless of sowing time. Timing of the direct seeding did not appear to be critical. This provides forest restoration project managers with flexibility in their use of this technique as a restoration tool. The advantages and disadvantages of direct seeding, immediately after seed collection or at the start of the rainy were compared with those of conventional tree planting. We conclude that species selection matters more than timing, when direct-seeding in forest restoration projects (except for recalcitrant species, which can only be direct seeded soon after seed collection). From this study, Adenanthera microsperma, Bauhinia variegata, Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica and Prunus cerasoides are recommended, for direct seeding, to restore seasonally dry upland evergreen forest ecosystems in northern Thailand and at other sites within their natural species ranges.@@@Direct seeding

We studied the effects of saline stress, alone or interacting with hypoxia, on growth, morphology and rooting process of six willows clones, assessing also whether rooting hormone (H, Indol Butyric Acid) contributes enhancing rooting under combined stress. Three hybrids of Salix matsudana × Salix alba (Sm×Sa), two of Salix babylonica × Salix alba (Sb×Sa) and a Salix nigra (Sn4) clone were evaluated in hydroponics. Ten treatments were generated combining salinity [moderate (MS): 5 dS/m, and high (HS): 10 dS/m]; hypoxia (with or without artificial aeration, HypO), and presence or absence of H. After 120 days, shoot and root biomass, root number and length, and hypertrophied lenticel number were evaluated. Contrary to what was expected, Sm×Sa and Sb×Sa hybrids showed no adverse additive effects of combined stress compared with saline stress; whereas in Sn4, S + HypO favored root biomass production increasing number and elongation of roots. Salinity was the main limiting factor for root production, being only MS conditions compatible with rooting, although limited. There was no common response in relation to H addition. In Sn4, H potentiated the effects of MS + HypO on root biomass, increasing number of roots. However, it had no positive effect on biomass production in the remaining hybrids, producing a higher root number but shorter in length. More effort is needed to understand the physiological mechanisms behind the response to combined stress in willows.@@@Willow

Despite the key role of fine roots in carbon and nutrient cycling, root phenology is less well characterized than shoot phenology, due largely to methodological problems when measuring root systems at depths > 1.0 m. Fine root demography is also poorly related to the better established patterns of aboveground primary and secondary growth. We examined the influence of climatic factors on the dynamics of fine root elongation rate (RER), to a depth of 4.7 m, and assessed relationships with shoot phenology of walnut trees (Juglans nigra × J. regia) in a Mediterranean agroforestry system. Rhizotrons and minirhizotrons were installed for 21 months to monitor RER. Dendrometers were used to measure trunk and lateral root radial growth during the same period. Results showed that RER was not synchronous with budbreak and leaf unfolding (occurring from April to May) at any soil depth. However, during phase 2 of the growing season (June–November), daily RER in the upper soil (0.00–1.70 m) was synchronous with both trunk and lateral root radial growth, which were themselves positively correlated with the mean monthly soil and air temperatures and the mean monthly solar irradiance. Mean daily RER was not correlated to mean monthly soil and air temperatures at any soil depth during phase 2 of the growing season. However, during this period, mean daily RER of very shallow roots (0.00–0.85 m) was significantly and positively correlated with both mean monthly soil water content and solar irradiance. Maximal daily RER occurred during phase 2 of the growing season for the three upper soil layers (June–October), but peaked during the aerial dormant season (December) in the deepest soil layer (4.00–4.70 m). We conclude that drivers of phenology for different tree organs and between shallow and deep roots are not the same. This spatial plasticity in growth throughout a tree enables it to maximize resource uptake, even throughout the winter months, and thus is a highly useful mechanism for increasing tree resistance to abiotic stresses.@@@Phenology

This article assesses the suitability of Eucalyptus for biomass production. The first part of the article compares Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus gunnii against short rotation forestry (SRF) species proposed by Hardcastle (A review of the impacts of short-rotation forestry, LTS International, Edinburgh, 2006), while the second part discusses limitations to the growing of eucalypts in the UK and how they may be overcome. Eucalypts compare favourably with other tree species in the UK in terms of rapid growth (up to 30 m3 ha−1 y−1) over short rotations of 10–15 years. The only genus that is potentially as productive in the UK is Nothofagus. Furthermore, most species will readily coppice, enabling regeneration after damage and avoiding the costs of replanting. The wood characteristics compare positively with other SRF species, exhibiting a moderate wood density, but limitations are a relatively high moisture and chlorine content. Many of the SRF species listed in Hardcastle (2006) are now damaged or under threat from damage by exotic pests or diseases. Eucalypts are currently relatively free from such damage. It is cold temperatures that most limits the use of eucalypts in the UK. Eucalypts, particularly when young are vulnerable to damage from cold weather events, particularly when temperatures drop rapidly. However, the risk can be reduced by planting appropriate species and provenances, facilitating rapid growth as smaller trees are more vulnerable and by focusing on species that coppice following damage.@@@Eucalyptus

Fertilization can affect water use. However, the effects of fertilization on tree growth patterns during extreme droughts periods remain unknown. A throughfall exclusion experiment was set up in São Paulo State-Brazil to study the effects of potassium (K) and sodium (Na) fertilization and their interaction with water supply in the growth of Eucalyptus grandis trees over an abnormal season of 6 months of extreme drought in comparison with that in normal seasons, as well as the differences in responsiveness to intra-annual meteorological variability. Arranged in a split-plot design, the factors were water supply (37% throughfall exclusion vs. no throughfall exclusion) and fertilization regime (K, Na, and control). Basal area growth was monitored by band dendrometers measurements at 14-day intervals over 2 years. Meteorological and soil water content data were also collected. K and Na fertilization increased the tree basal area by four and three-fold, respectively, during normal seasons. During a severe drought season, these positive effects were suppressed. However, K- and Na-fertilized trees achieved a similar cumulative basal area increment to that of the control trees. The 37% throughfall exclusion significantly decreased tree growth in all treatments only in the severe drought period, and these effects were stronger in K-fertilized trees. K-fertilized trees were highly responsive to intra-annual meteorological variability. Our results suggest that extreme drought has similar effects on E. grandis tree growth regardless of the K/Na fertilization regime.@@@Band dendrometers

Despite the expanded use, efficacy of these rehabilitation treatments on soil quality as well as seedling survival and growth rate are crucial issues that require further attention. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of two soil amendment techniques including straw (1.27 kg m−2) and litter (1.67 kg m−2) mulch on soil properties and growth properties of Caucasian alder. Three treatments: straw mulch (SM), litter mulch (LM) and untreated trail (U) were applied on newly established machine operating trails subjected to low, medium, and high machine traffic intensity classes and compared to the undisturbed area (i.e., control; UND). Approximately 22 months after ground-based machine traffic and mulching application, seeds of Caucasian alder were sown in each treatment and in the undisturbed area and further extracted after the first growing season to assess their growth rates. Three years after applying mulch on the compacted soil, recovery values of soil physical and chemical properties (with the exception of soil C/N ratio) in all traffic intensities were significantly higher in LM than SM, compared to U treatment. Nevertheless, recovery values of soil physical and chemical properties were still higher than values in UND area over a 3-year period. All the measured growth and biomass responses of Caucasian alder seedlings changed significantly with increasing traffic intensities (all P ≤ 0.05). Significantly higher seed germination percentage was recorded in LM with low traffic intensity (54%). Significantly higher seedling stem height (17.3 cm), main root length (23.6 cm), seedling total (7.68 g), shoot (2.87 g), and root dry (4.81 g) biomass were observed in the UND area followed by LM with low traffic ≈ LM with medium traffic treatments, whereas the lowest values of seedling size and biomass were detected on U with low, medium, and high traffic intensities. Seedling root mass ratio (RMR; 61%) and root to shoot ratio (R/S; 1.89) were greatest in the UND area, while the RMR (40%) and R/S (0.86) were least in the U plots with high traffic intensity. We can conclude that the highest seedling growth, biomass, and allocation ratios and favorable soil physical, chemical, and bio-chemical properties can be attributed to UND, LM with low and medium traffic, and SM with low traffic treatments.@@@Soil compaction

Existing demand for elite individuals endangers the conservation of interesting germplasm, prompting the development of efficient protocols for the establishment of orchards for tree breeding. Based on previous work regarding grafting adult individuals onto young rootstocks, superior trees from Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Campeche, Mexico were employed as a source of explants for plant regeneration after successive rounds of grafting and micrografting onto juvenile rootstocks. The results showed that root length and appearance, internode distance, leaf length and number, and plant height values for trees derived from successive rounds of grafting and micrografting were similar to those obtained from juvenile trees derived from seeds, suggesting that developmental traits associated with reinvigoration were partially induced following the reported procedure. This protocol may be useful for the propagation of mature elite trees belonging to the Meliaceae family.@@@Micrografting

"1075","Nutrient dynamics in an Andean forest region: a case study of exotic and native species plantations in southern Ecuador@@@@@@Received: 26 March 2019 Accepted: 30 July 2019 Published: 03 August 2019 Issue Date: March 2020@@@Information about nutrient dynamics is of upmost importance in order to contribute to the restoration of degraded forest environments in the Andes of southern Ecuador. This study aims to investigate the differences of nutrient dynamics between a native alder (Alnus acuminata) and an exotic pine (Pinus patula) tree species in this region. Based on litterfall, forest floor and mineral topsoil (0–20 cm) of two pine and two alder plantations, we studied the litterfall production and its seasonality; temporal variations of nutrient concentrations, stoichiometric ratios and potential nutrient return (PNR) of leaf-litterfall; mean residence times (MRT) of nutrients in the forest floor; and assessed soil biogeochemical properties. Our results showed that total litterfall production in pine was twice as high as in alder. Litterfall biomass seasonality was similar for both species and highly associated to periods with less precipitation. Pine exhibited the highest seasonality of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios. PNR of N, K, Ca, and Mn exhibited the major differences between the species. The annual PNR of N and Ca were higher in alder, while those of K and Mn were higher in pine. Pine exhibited higher MRT values for C, N, P, S, Cu, and Zn, while alder showed the higher for Mg, K, Mn, and Ca. In soils, alder exhibited higher concentrations and stocks of nutrients, but not for C. Although, the soil microbial biomass was similar under both species, microbial activity was different. C and net N mineralization were higher in alder, and nitrification dominated over ammonification processes. In general, our findings show a faster cycling of nutrients in alder than in pine.@@@Andean alder

Our objective was to determine mycorrhizal efficacy to support cedar growth and nutrient supply as part of a low-impact approach for ecological restoration of cedar in peatlands. We tested the effectiveness of AM inoculation in a greenhouse experiment in factorial combination with fertilization and liming. We also determined AM colonization rate in the different treatment combinations. We found that AM inoculation in the absence of fertilization significantly increased all growth parameters, phosphorus (P) concentrations, and N, P, and copper (Cu) content of the seedlings, and decreased N:P ratios. Fertilizer alone had a similar impact on plant growth and nutrient acquisition when compared to un-fertilized AM inoculation treatments. Liming alone was ineffective at increasing cedar growth and nutrient uptake. There were many interactions of AM inoculation with liming and fertilization. Specifically, the positive effect of AM inoculation on many growth and nutrition metrics was strongly reduced in the presence of fertilization, whereas the P benefit of mycorrhizas appeared to increase under liming. We conclude that addition of AM inoculation alone improved cedar growth and P acquisition, reducing the need for fertilizer and lime in peatlands. However, seedling N limitation might be a problem in strongly N-deficient peat soils.@@@Northern white-cedar

Little is known about how these historical practices affected long-term vegetation changes. An experimental watershed in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was partially harvested in the years 1942–1952 according to these exploitive practices. We compared the partial-cut watershed to a clear-cut watershed and an untreated, reference watershed. Using long-term vegetation surveys, we analyzed patterns in aboveground biomass accumulation, species composition and diversity (Shannon’s index Hʹ and species richness) among watersheds. Contrary to our expectations, the partial-cut watershed recovered to reference levels of aboveground biomass and their species composition was similar over time. The clear-cut watershed had greater abundance of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) than the other two watersheds. The partial-cut watershed increased in diversity over time, but it remained less diverse than the reference watershed; whereas, the clear-cut watershed had lower diversity than the other two watersheds, and its diversity did not change over time. Distributions of functional groups based on water use and nutrient acquisition traits, and shade tolerance were similar between the partial-cut and the reference watersheds, but differed from the clear-cut watershed. By the 2010s, partial-cut and reference watersheds had similar proportions of diffuse-porous (32% and 33%) and ring-porous (48% and 42%) basal area, while the clear-cut watershed had more diffuse-porous (43%) and less ring-porous (36%) species than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Tree species associated with arbuscular mycorrhiza were more abundant in the clear-cut watershed than the partial-cut or reference watersheds. Overall, the partial-cut watershed, even with the extreme soil disturbance, did not alter long-term species composition and diversity as dramatically as the clear-cut watershed. These results could help forest managers, conservationists, and hydrologists understand the long-term effects of partial-cutting versus clear-cutting.@@@Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory

However, challenges of prior site conditions, seasonal flooding, soil texture and lack of nearby seed sources can necessitate planting of seedlings to achieve desirable results, particularly for large-seeded species like oaks. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare growth and survival of two species of oaks common to southeastern and bottomland hardwood forests, cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) and willow oak (Quercus phellos L.) from 1-0 bareroot, conventional container (0.24 L) and large container (3.8 L) planting stocks across two growing seasons. Additionally, we sought to compare physiology across seedling types to determine the underlying differences in functioning that led to the growth responses. Despite above average rainfall, growth was modest particularly at the site that was previously pasture land and for willow oak which also exhibited net dieback. Two-year survival was adequate (> 75%) for bareroot and large container seedlings but was suboptimal (~ 50%) for conventional container seedlings. Large container seedlings had about 40% higher photosynthetic rates and 70% higher water use efficiencies compared to bareroot and conventional container seedlings. Cherrybark oak exhibited greater stomatal regulation across the growing season than willow oak, however all seedling types displayed increased stomatal conductance and decreased water use efficiency throughout the growing season. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of matching species to site conditions and providing competition control particularly on grassland sites and during above average rainfall conditions.@@@Afforestation

A 12 × 12 full-diallel mating design with selfing was adopted, and data were collected in 2005 and 2014 at 20 and 29 years after planting. Based on an analysis of 55 of 144 potential crosses, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were statistically significant for these traits. Variance was larger in SCA than in GCA in 2005, and the ratio of SCA to GCA was lower in 2014. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability were low to moderate, ranging from 0.10 for DBH to 0.14 for H, in 2005 and decreased in all traits except H as the trees aged. The reciprocal effect was not significant. Selfed progeny did not show severe inbreeding depression for survival or growth. The results of this study will facilitate the development of breeding and deployment strategies to increase the efficiency of genetic improvement in Japanese larch.@@@Japanese larch

Paper industries have interest in Eucalyptus globulus Labill and its hybrids due to low lignin and lipid contents, which facilitate cellulose extraction. However, this species and some of its hybrids are recalcitrant to rooting, often requiring exogenous auxin supply. Here we performed a comparative analysis of proteome changes during AR of E. globulus and the easy-to-root species Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill and the effects of exogenous auxin in different phases of the process (induction and formation), using a label-free quantification method. We identified 398 differentially abundant proteins, which were predicted to be involved in different biological pathways, mainly oxidative stress, energy metabolism and photosynthesis. Notable differences between species included proteins involved in oxidative stress, carbon and secondary metabolism. Exogenous auxin appeared to affect the availability of carbon sources and other phytohormones, besides cell cycle and microtubule—related proteins. Important players were also identified in each phase of AR. This is the first in depth analysis of protein changes during AR in Eucalyptus. The findings can be used in future studies to evaluate rooting competence in different genotypes and provide leads for AR improvement.@@@Adventitious roots

Adaptive variation among seed sources may also be an important factor in the effectiveness of standardized nursery protocols for seedling production. Particularly for wide-ranging species, regional optimizations of nursery protocols may be necessary to ensure consistent production of quality seedling stock. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is one such species, possessing the broadest distribution of any tree in North America. However, research on nursery protocols specific to aspen has focused on seed sources from a limited region in western boreal Canada. A well-established protocol shown to be effective for these boreal aspen uses a shoot growth inhibitor designed to maximize desirable seedling quality traits for outplanting success. We used this protocol on seeds sourced from two different regions in the southwestern portion of the species range (Utah and New Mexico, USA) and compared their response in the same nursery environment to that of a seedlot from Alberta, Canada to determine whether this protocol is also applicable for these very different regions. Seedlings from Utah and New Mexico differed significantly in their response to the protocol from the Alberta source, developing smaller root-to-stem ratios and sequestering less carbohydrate and nutrient reserves. Seedlings from Utah and New Mexico sources also differed from each other, with New Mexico seedlings growing larger according to all metrics. These results indicate that aspen nursery protocols will benefit from regional modification in order to optimize seedling stock quality and trait consistency.@@@Aspen restoration

We evaluated a stratification treatment of 48 h of chilling imbibition (3 °C) versus control imbibition (25 °C) in seeds of the Andean tree Alnus acuminata (Kunth). Five concentrations of As: 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mg L−1 were tested in both groups of seeds to determine whether chilling imbibition affects the germination, vigor of seedlings and tolerance to arsenic. Physiological, biochemical and morphometric traits were evaluated in germinants to establish how chilling imbibition and As modulate the early development. Growth and tolerance index were estimated in seedlings of 70 days. We found that chilling imbibition enhanced the germination tolerance to arsenic and this effect was unaltered by its concentration. The germinants accumulated arsenic and the maximum reduction of growth was around 28%, but these germinants reached the stage of seedling without negative affectations in final size or biomass. The emergence of the first leaf was delayed in germinants coming from seeds imbibed at 25 °C and exposed to As. Chilling imbibition increased the allometric relationship between size and biomass in germinants exposed to As, improving the vigor and tolerance in more than 55%. Our results suggest that accumulation of As in cotyledons, a high content of carbohydrates and proteins, the activity of SOD, POX and probably the synthesis of phytochelatins are the strategies of tolerance in germinants coming from pre-chilled seeds. This treatment becomes important for the implementation of A. acuminata in forestry programs for soils affected by coal mining.@@@Antioxidant enzymes

This work quantified individual tree growth patterns of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson), a western US species, planted outside of its natural range in Minnesota, USA. After 50 years, survival was as high as 69% for some ponderosa pine seed sources, and individuals from the Black Hills, Eastern High Plains, and South and East Montana regions of the western US were some of the tallest and largest diameter trees grown in Minnesota. Predictions of total tree height and diameter increment displayed the lowest bias when equations for ponderosa pine in the western US were used rather than equations for red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) in Minnesota, a species that occupies a similar ecological niche. These results indicate that using existing growth and yield equations from a species’ native range may provide a suitable representation of growth and yield patterns if observations from outside the species’ native range are lacking. Historical data from provenance trials such as these can provide a long-term record to quantify the growth potential of non-native species in anticipation of future climate scenarios.@@@Pinus ponderosa

Since 1983, The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) has engaged in a breeding program aimed at restoring C. dentata to the wild. The primary goal has been to introduce blight resistance from Castanea mollissima while recovering a C. dentata phenotype via successive backcrosses. To diversify the genetic base, state chapters of TACF have been producing BC3 and BC4 (third and fourth backcross) lines using C. dentata from across its native range. This study focuses on morphology and chemistry of seeds, and morphology and early growth of seedlings derived from BC3 and BC4 trees selected for blight resistance in state chapters. Our primary comparisons were among backcross, pure C. mollissima, and pure C. dentata lines. Seed traits included a suite of morphological characters known to differ between C. dentata and C. mollissima, as well as dry matter, total carbohydrate, sugar, protein, lipid, and phenolic content. Seedling traits included variables such as stem basal diameter and height, leaf variables such as number and area, and relative growth in key parameters such as stem volume. C. mollissima lines tended to differ significantly from C. dentata and backcross lines in most parameters, while C. dentata and backcross types tended to overlap broadly in traits. These results suggest that seed and seedling characteristics of backcross hybrids studied here are likely to be sufficiently similar to C. dentata for use in restoration programs.@@@Castanea dentata

There is interest in identifying alternative sources to KCl owing to its high cost and limited reserves. The aim of the study was to test the effect of replacing KCl with NaCl and phonolite rock powder. Two comparisons were made: (1) application of 283 kg ha−1 of KCl compared with that of 2125 kg ha−1 of phonolite rock powder (equivalent to 170 kg ha−1 of K2O in both treatments); (2) application of 139 kg ha−1 of NaCl compared with that of 183 kg ha−1 of KCl (equivalent to 2.33 kmol Na and K, respectively). Radial growth, soil water content, leaf water potential (Ψ), accumulated transpiration, stem volume and biomass increment, as well as water use efficiency (WUE) were evaluated. In the first comparison, both fertilizations presented equal values for all characteristics evaluated. In the second, the accumulated transpiration in trees fertilized with KCl was 17% higher than that in plants fertilized with NaCl. In contrast, the WUE was 20% higher in the trees fertilized with NaCl than in those fertilized with KCl, reflecting the lower water consumption for the same increment in stem volume and biomass. We conclude that phonolite rock powder and NaCl are possible substitutes for conventional K fertilization performed with KCl.@@@Potassium

However, it remains unclear to what extent geographical gradients in growth and wood quality are shaped by the environment. We used data of 197 trees from 22 natural populations to assess geographic variation patterns in radial growth and wood density, and their correlations with environmental factors. Significant differences in mean annual DBH and wood basic density were observed among the 22 populations (p < 0.05). Based on mean annual DBH and wood basic density, the 22 populations were classified into three groups by hierarchical cluster analysis. Within its natural distribution, soil nutrients are more closely associated with DBH growth than are temperature and precipitation. However, correlations between wood density versus altitude and annual precipitation were found (p < 0.01). Trend surface analysis revealed that mean annual DBH growth and wood density displayed an increasing trend from north-west to south-east across its natural distribution. Our study provides valuable insights into the geographical patterns in growth and wood quality of C. paliurus, and an opportunity to improve tree growth and wood quality through phenotypic selection and selecting suitable sites for planting.@@@Cyclocarya paliurus

Its impact on the relative performance of the regeneration of different tree species could also be affected by site conditions and forest structure. The objective of this study was to determine how regeneration establishment of Nothofagus mixed forests is influenced by shelterwood silvicultural system. We focused on Lanín National Reserve (Neuquén, Argentina) where this silvicultural system has been applied since the late 1980s. The microsite scale analysis (one managed forest) showed that canopy cover was a key factor conditioning Nothofagus regeneration establishment, with older and larger individuals growing in less exposed microsites. Low understory dominance and leaf litter thickness were also associated with microsites with regeneration, while successful establishment (saplings taller than 2 m) showed positive correlation with soil moisture. Variations of these patterns were observed among species reflecting their specific eco-physiological requirements. On a stand scale (two managed forests along Lacar watershed) regeneration of N. dombeyi and N. alpina showed significant correlation with site and specific basal area, while N. obliqua was correlated with total basal area. Regeneration taller than 2 m was mainly correlated with site and altitude. At both, microsite and stand scale, the relative abundance of species changed between mature trees and regeneration. In particular, for N. alpina, an abundance decrease was observed on regeneration. Our results suggest that forest management systems should diversify silvicultural practices throughout the forest landscape, to provide at each site the micro-environmental conditions required by each species in order to maintain biodiversity and forest functions.@@@Silvicultural prescriptions

Here, we present results from the first growing season following salvage logging on four gaps (3.5–6 ha) created by a 2012 tornado. While salvage logging shifted the distribution of stem heights to smaller sizes, it increased woody species seedling diversity by 33% and total plant richness and diversity by 20%. Salvaging did not alter or homogenize community composition. These short-term differences in richness and diversity were partly driven by a more even distribution of seedlings among species and increased species recruitment from the seed bank after salvaging. Overall, the initial impacts of salvage operations in a mixed deciduous forest redirected forest regeneration towards a more diverse community with a wider pool of species.@@@Wind disturbance

An analysis of competition in cork oak plantations is extremely relevant as a support for this important decision. This study aimed to understand the relationship between stand characteristics and tree growth efficiency, and subsequently help identify the presence or absence of an inter-tree competition pattern in cork oak stands that were never debarked. The inter-tree competition was assessed by looking to several stand characteristics: (1) comparison with the self-thinning line; (2) stand density measures, such as stand spacing coefficient and relative spacing; (3) stand structure measures evaluated through the skewness and variability; and (4) tree relative growth rate pattern over tree size. Data used for this analysis were gathered from permanent plots that were established in even-aged stands located across the cork oak distribution area in Portugal. The study shows that the most common stand densities on young cork oak plantations might not lead to serious inter-tree competition before the first cork extraction. This information is relevant to support the potential timing and severity of the first thinning in order to retain more trees until the second cork extraction when cork quality can be taken into account in the selection of the trees to be removed.@@@Quercus suber L.

A side-effect of MeJA application is temporarily reduced height growth. This has generally been considered as negative, but in forest tree nurseries this could instead be beneficial since it is commonly desired to stop the growth of nursery seedlings in late summer. Artificially longer dark periods (long nights/short days) are widely used in high-latitude nurseries to terminate height growth and induce freezing tolerance. However, long night treatment requires specialized nursery equipment and are labor intensive. Therefore alternatives are sought after. We compared long-night and MeJA treatments by following the growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings throughout one season. The regulatory effect of MeJA on height growth was similar if not even better than that of long nights, i.e. it was terminated faster. However, MeJA treatment also reduced root growth and delayed the development of freezing tolerance. MeJA may therefore not replace long-night treatments, but it could facilitate a more flexible application of long nights by gaining a longer time interval during which this treatment can be used without risking the seedlings growing too large.@@@Diameter

However, the germination rate of Chinese fir seed lots is low, and viability determination by conventional methods (germination test and tetrazolium test) is time-consuming and destructive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for rapidly and non-destructively determining viability of Chinese fir seeds. A total of 450 seeds was first identified as viable, empty, or dead (n = 150 seeds per seed lot fraction) by digital X-ray and their viability was further confirmed by germination test. NIR reflectance spectra were collected from single seeds using XDS Rapid Content Analyzer from 780 to 2500 nm. Classification models were developed on calibration set (n = 300 seeds) by Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) using the entire or selected NIR regions, and the fitted models were validated using external test set (n = 150 seeds). The model’s ability to recognize members (sensitivity) while rejecting non-members (specificity) of a given class was 100% for viable and dead seeds and 98% for empty seeds, attesting to the model’s robustness. When the model was fitted in the shorter NIR region (780–1100 nm), the sensitivity and specificity reached 100% for all seed lot fractions. The mean classification accuracy was 99% in the full and longer NIR regions and 100% in the shorter NIR region. The spectral differences among seed lot fractions could be attributed to differences in seed coat chemical composition in empty and dead seeds, presumably tannin content, and major storage reserves in viable seeds, notably fatty acids, proteins, and carbohydrate. It can be concluded that NIR spectroscopy has a great potential to evaluate Chinese fir seed quality, which could be applied in the development of an on-line sorting system.@@@Cunninghamia lanceolata

A mixture of the less polar gibberellins, GA4 and GA7, has been shown to promote flowering in Pinaceae species, but the responses vary significantly based on species, genotype and provenance, application method, timing and dosage. Previous studies with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) suggest that the response to exogenous GA4/7 varied among genotypes. Gibberellins also play a critical role in seed development and germination but it remains unclear how exogenous GA4/7 will affect seed quality. We used 25 lodgepole pine genotypes in a commercial seed orchard in Alberta, Canada to explore the impact of genotype and geographic origin on the efficacy and optimal timing of GA4/7 stem injections to promote female cone bud initiation, cones and seed production. Overall, we found that GA4/7 stem injections promoted female conelets in 40% of genotypes included in this study. For these 10 genotypes, we found that the latitude of their provenance was positively correlated with later effective application times. Of the remaining 15 genotypes, five were hypersensitive to exogenous GA4/7 showing needle discolouration and loss, and 10 genotypes showed no response. In general, stem-injected GA4/7 did not affect the number of seeds per cone while two genotypes showed a reduced seed yield and one genotype showed increased seed yield per cone. Seed weights were not affected by the stem-injected GA4/7, while the July application date resulted in higher germination rates compared to control trees.@@@Tree improvement

The objective of this work was to evaluate the dynamics of flumioxazin, sulfentrazone, and isoxaflutole herbicides applied on different amounts and compositions of eucalyptus harvest residues subjected to different rainfall depths; and evaluate the weed control effectiveness of these herbicides when applied under these conditions. A LC–MS/MS system was used for the evaluations and the results showed that a cumulative rainfall of 50 mm was sufficient for the maximum removal of herbicides from the eucalyptus residues, regardless of the residue composition. The amount of the flumioxazin, sulfentrazone, and isoxaflutole herbicides that reached the soil was lower in the treatment with the highest amount of eucalyptus harvest residue used (40 Mg ha−1). The greatest amount of herbicide reaching the soil was found with the use of 15 Mg ha−1 of residues without presence of bark. The highest amount of residue used (40 Mg ha−1) reduced the control of Brachiaria decumbens by sulfentrazone and isoxaflutole. The control of Commelina benghalensis was inefficient (> 80%) in the treatment with 15 Mg ha−1 of residues without barks, regardless of the herbicide. Sulfentrazone controlled Ipomoea grandifolia (> 90%) under the evaluated residue conditions. Spermacoce latifolia and Sida rhombifolia were controlled by all herbicides in the evaluated residue conditions. Isoxaflutole controlled Panicum maximum in all residue conditions. The choice between the herbicides depends on the residue condition, rainfall regime, and weed species to be controlled.@@@Preemergent herbicides

Importantly, climate change projections support increased frequency and intensity of droughts in the future. In order to evaluate whether thinning practices can be used as efficient adaptation strategies to climate change, we measured canopy cover as a surrogate of defoliation in 49 Quercus ilex L. subsp. ilex individual genets subjected to experimental ramet thinning. Canopy cover measurements were obtained before, during and after the exceptionally intense and prolonged drought of 2016. Our results show that intensity of basal area reduction determined higher resistance, but not resilience, to this intense-long drought period. Independently of shoot thinning intensity, every holm oak exhibited crown defoliation during the dry period but most of them recovered their leaves the next spring. Holm oaks subjected to thinning with more than over 50% of basal area removed, were less vulnerable to severe drought, however, and supported more leaves later on. Additionally, our results highlight the positive influence of canopy shading from neighbouring trees preventing defoliation after drought events. A greater canopy shading per stool led to a higher resistance in holm oak trees exposed to severe drought. These findings suggest that, in order to cope with concomitant climate change and to optimize genet-level stress tolerance, coppice selection should be done by removing shoots with fewer leaves per unit area, preferably those unexposed to shading from neighbouring trees until a reduction around 50% of basal area per stool is achieved.@@@Holm oak

For forest restoration, structural complexity is a recognised indicator of ecosystem biodiversity and in turn a surrogate for restoration effectiveness. Structural complexity captures the diversity in vegetation elements, from tree height to species composition, and the layering of these elements is critical for dependent organisms which rely upon them for their survival. Traditional methods of measuring structural complexity are costly and time-consuming, resulting in a discrepancy between the scales of ‘available’ versus ‘needed’ information. With advancements in both sensors and platforms, there exists an unprecedented opportunity for landscape-level effectiveness monitoring using remote sensing. We here review the key literature on passive (e.g., optical) and active (e.g., LiDAR) sensors and their available platforms (spaceborne to unmanned aerial vehicles) used to capture structural attributes at the tree- and stand-level relevant for effectiveness monitoring. Good cross-validation between remotely sensed and ground truthed data has been shown for many traditional attributes, but remote sensing offers opportunities for assessment of novel or difficult to measure attributes. While there are examples of the application of such technologies in forestry and conservation ecology, there are few reports of remote sensing for monitoring the effectiveness of ecological restoration actions in reversing land degradation. Such monitoring requires baseline data for the restoration site as well as benchmarking the trajectory of remediation against the structural complexity of a reference system.@@@Structural complexity

Ninety-seven seed lots of 91 species were collected in the Dominican Republic and tested for germination immediately after collecting, and after drying and moist storage. Seed desiccation sensitivity was assessed as a continuous variable (Viability Loss Index; VLI), based on seed germination values before and after drying. The results were compared with predictions of seed desiccation responses based on seed lot traits (initial moisture content and thousand-seed weight) and with those of published predictive models based on plant and seed traits. VLI could be calculated for seed lots of 40 species. 80% of these seed lots showed consistent results among experiments and predictive models. Issues on the set up of the experiments were discussed, as well as the species for which experimental results and predictions led to contrasting results. Overall, the “100-seed test” confirmed to be an effective tool for assessing seed desiccation responses of a diverse under-investigated woody flora, guiding the seed conservation of trees and their use in reforestation programmes. In addition, by providing new data, it might improve the performance of available predictive models.@@@Ex situ conservation

During the last decade, the plantations have been severely attacked by Ralstonia solanacearum bacterial wilt, causing widespread decline and mortality. It has been thought that lack of genetic diversity, both within individual sites and at a regional scale, may render the plantations particularly susceptible to attack. Analysis of samples from 109 separate plantations in three provinces, Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian, using microsatellite molecular markers, revealed that only 22 separate clones are in use. Analysis of co-ancestry among the clones further revealed that many are closely related, consistent with selection of new clones from the sexually-reproduced offspring of existing ones, or selection of multiple clones from individual seedling families. Comparison with wild materials from throughout the species’ natural range indicated that the origins of the South China clones are most likely from within the Southeast Asian region. We recommend diversifying the genetic base of planting material in South China and planting a more-diverse mix of unrelated clones at local and regional scales.@@@Casuarina equisetifolia

Germination of stored dormant seeds proceeds after dormancy breaking induced by stratification. To improve understanding of dormancy breaking in beechnuts, we: investigated effects of moisture content and temperature during storage; analysed contents of abscisic acid, abscisic acid metabolites and indole-3-acetic acid in embryonic axes during storage and stratification; and histochemically localized storage proteins in embryogenic axes and cotyledons of beechnut embryos. The results show that storage conditions can affect the nuts’ abscisic acid contents, but not the stratification process. In addition, dormancy breaking is linked to a reduction in abscisic acid contents and depth of dormancy is not influenced by either of these storage factors. Detected changes that correlated most strongly with dormancy breaking were a big increase in abscisic acid-glucosyl ester levels and accompanying reduction in the abscisic acid-glucosyl ester to abscisic acid ratio. We detected extremely low concentrations of other abscisic acid metabolites-neophaseic, phaseic and dihydrophaseic acids—in non-dormant stored beechnuts, but somewhat higher concentrations during dormancy. No relationships between changes in indole-3-acetic acid levels with either storage conditions or dormancy breaking were detected. Changes in distributions of storage proteins were related to the seeds’ moisture content during storage and stratification rather than seed dormancy. We conclude that increases in endogenous abscisic acid-glucosyl ester levels and abscisic acid-glucosyl ester to abscisic acid ratios are good markers of depth of dormancy and/or effectiveness of stratification in beechnuts.@@@ABA

Dry and imbibed seeds were stratified at 1 °C and 5 °C for 1, 2, 4 and 6 months. Germination percentage, mean germination time (MGT) and germination rate index (GRI) were measured to determine the optimal low temperature and its duration for the release of primary physiological dormancy. Once primary physiological dormancy was released through cold stratification, seeds were stored in an environment in which the temperature progressively increased from 5 to 25 °C. After one month of storage at each storage temperature, the germination percentage, MGT and GRI were measured to determine the threshold temperature for the induction of secondary physiological dormancy. Both dry and imbibed seeds not only exhibited a high germination percentage (approximately 80%) but also germinated rapidly (MGT and GRI were 17 days and 2.36, respectively) after 6 months of storage at either 1 °C or 5 °C. The germination percentage of cold stratified seeds gradually decreased from 78% (5 °C) to 72% (10 °C), 55% (15 °C), 10% (20 °C) and 8% (25 °C). The results of this study suggest that stratifying seeds at 1 °C or 5 °C for 6 months releases primary physiological dormancy.

This would happen even in the case of soils substitution that currently have an agricultural use although its implementation would require more studies on the environmental impact that they could have in each particular case. In this study, the potential of electric power production is evaluated with several species of Eucalyptus planted in short rotation forestry systems. Three species were evaluated: E. benthamii, E. dunnii and E. grandis in four spacings: 3 × 1.5 m, 3 × 1 m, 3 × 0.75 m, 3 × 0.5 m, in two sites in the northern and western areas of Uruguay during a period of 76 and 75 months, respectively. During this period, the following parameters were evaluated: higher heating value, wood density, energy density and energy yield per hectare and per year. The results obtained show that the heating value changes slightly with the planting density and age. The average of higher heating values were 19,787 versus 19,454 J g−1 and 19,867 versus 9909 J g−1for the planting densities of 2220 versus 6660 trees ha−1 at Paysandú and Tacuarembó, respectively, at 76 months. Higher heating value increased from 19,665 to 19,745 J g−1 at 18 months to 19,740 and 19,914 J g−1 at 76 months for Paysandú and Tacuarembó, respectively. The wood density, depending on the site, is affected by age, species and planting density. On average, wood density increased (only at Paysandú) from 0.405 g cm−3 at age 18 months to 0.497 g cm−3 at age 76 months. There is a negative relationship between the heating value and the wood density. The energy yield is basically explained by the production of biomass. At Tacuarembó, a stronger relationship between energy production and planting density is obtained (1012 vs. 636 MW ha−1 for 6660 and 2220 trees ha−1, respectively) compared to the Paysandú site (1093 vs. 912 MW ha−1 for 6660 and 2220 trees ha−1, respectively).

Small-caliber roundwood from sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) coppices, formerly in great demand, is now less interesting for the market. Thus, the improvement of coppices management by applying alternative silvicultural models in order to obtain benefits and sustainability is essential. For this purpose, four permanent plots (P1–P4) were established in 1994 to monitor different coppice management systems. The plots were installed in a coppice which resulted from the final clear cut of a sweet chestnut high-forest stand in 1992, at 50 years old. Three silvicultural management models were tested in order to produce roundwood of small (P1), medium (P2), and large (P4) diameters. A control plot was established without any type of silviculture which corresponds to most of the existing chestnut coppices (P3 = without intervention). Thinnings were applied in the plots according to the respective management model. Twenty-four years after the sprouting of the coppice, the silvicultural models were evaluated according to their objectives in terms of growth, yield, and quality of the sawlogs. This assessment period corresponds to the end of the rotation period for P1, and the results are in accordance with expected values. In P2 and P4 the observed growth closely matches expectations for this growth stage of the coppice. The quality of the sawlogs is clearly superior to that of the plot without intervention. Comparing the mean dendrometric values, higher values were observed in plots where the models were applied. The results also show that when roundwood is used for saw-timber, silvicultural management is essential.@@@Castanea sativa Mill.

We reviewed current knowledge regarding the effects of high temperatures and water deficits on post-fire recruitment processes of four major tree species (Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera) in order to anticipate the effects of climate change on forest recovery following fire in the boreal biome. We also produced maps of future vulnerability of post-fire recruitment by combining tree distributions in Canada with projections of temperature, moisture index and fire regime for the 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 periods. Although our review reveals that information is lacking for some regeneration stages, it highlights the response variability to climate conditions between species. The recruitment process of black spruce is likely to be the most affected by rising temperatures and water deficits, but more tolerant species are also at risk of being impacted by projected climate conditions. Our maps suggest that in eastern Canada, tree species will be vulnerable mainly to projected increases in temperature, while forests will be affected mostly by droughts in western Canada. Conifer-dominated forests are at risk of becoming less productive than they currently are, and eventually, timber supplies from deciduous species-dominated forests could also decrease. Our vulnerability maps are useful for prioritizing areas where regeneration monitoring efforts and adaptive measures could be developed.@@@Drought

This process becomes complicated in forests with high levels of precipitation due to the erosion and deposition of surface soil. Here, we investigated how soil compaction and slash dispersal on compacted soil affect soil nitrogen (N) mineralization in a high precipitation area with erodible volcanic soil in southern Japan. The physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured inside and outside the ruts of work roads in the presence and absence of dispersed slash in three Cryptomeria japonica plantations 9–10 months after clear-cutting and site preparation. We found that the soil N mineralization rate, particularly the soil nitrification rate, was lower in compacted soil, but the dispersal of slash after soil compaction enhanced the soil N mineralization and nitrification rates. Soil compaction also led to a low soil water permeability and high volumetric soil water content and was associated with the erosion and deposition of surface soil, with soil deposition including organic matter, being observed under dispersed slash. Additionally, the soil carbon (C) and N concentrations were lower in compacted soil but improved under dispersed slash. Principal component analysis showed that soil compaction and the soil C and N concentrations were closely related to each other on the first principal component (PC1), while the soil C/N ratio was separated from other factors on PC2. Furthermore, the scores of both PC1 and PC2 were related to soil N mineralization. These results suggest that soil compaction by forestry machines has a negative impact on soil N mineralization under high precipitation, but slash dispersal on the compacted soil is an effective approach for maintaining the soil N mineralization. The soil C/N ratio is likely related with N mineralization in the impacted soils, but the negative relationship between soil compaction and soil C and N concentrations through the movement of surface soil containing these elements should also be considered to fully understand the changes in soil N mineralization that occurs in forests under high precipitation.@@@Forestry machine

However, knowledge on the influence of Christmas-tree plantations (CTP) on biodiversity is still scarce. We examined phytodiversity and soil and habitat-structure characteristics within young (CTP-YOUNG, tree age ≤ 6 years) and old (CTP-OLD, tree age > 6 years) conventionally managed CTP in comparison with the three most dominant habitat types within the study area: (1) intensively managed grasslands (GRASS), (2) windthrows (WIND) and (3) non-native spruce forests (FOREST) (nper sample type = 18). Our study revealed clear differences in soil characteristics, habitat structure and plant-species richness between the five sample types. These differences were most pronounced between three groups of habitats: (1) CTP, (2) GRASS and (3) WIND/FOREST. CTP were characterized by a typical habitat structure composed of a distinct shrub layer, an intermediate herb layer and a low litter cover. In contrast to the other sample types CTP had a comparably high cover of bare ground and stones/gravel. Due to the practiced management CTP were characterized by a unique plant species community composed of a high number of ruderal species and some neophytes. The differences between CTP-YOUNG and CTP-OLD were generally small. Next to management, phytodiversity in CTP was influenced by the size of CTP. Small-scale CTP generally had a higher phytodiversity. For the cultivation of Christmas trees, we recommend the reduction of herbicide use as far as possible. New plantations should be implemented preferentially within homogeneous landscapes composed of habitats with low importance for biodiversity.@@@Biodiversity conservation

However, while many canopy trees may establish under a shrub canopy, shade may also restrict seedling establishment. We assessed the potential of shrubs and canopy manipulations in restoring mature forest species in a stressful environment. Mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides, Nothofagaceae) seedlings were planted in October 2015 and December 2016 in post-disturbance grasslands. Growth and survival were monitored over three growing seasons in five canopy treatments: open grassland, mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium, Myrtaceae) shrubland with intact canopy, mixed-species shrubland with intact canopy, artificial gaps in mānuka shrubland; and the grassland edge of the mixed-species shrubland. Understorey light transmission and canopy openness were quantified during the first growing season using hemispherical photos. Canopy manipulations caused significant differences in the light availability and canopy openness among treatments. We observed that seedlings performed better in the mānuka shrub with gap and mixed-species shrub canopies (intact and edge treatments), perhaps due to moderate canopy openness in these treatments compared to open grasslands and intact mānuka canopy. Growth and survival were positively associated with moderate log(light) levels, which correspond to light conditions in manuka with gaps and intact mixed-species shrubs and are likely to represent the net effects of these treatments. The results demonstrated that early-successional shrubs could be managed as nurse plants to control the effect of over-shading and facilitate the growth and survival of canopy species in a stressful environment.@@@Artificial gap

These roots are sensitive to forest fertilization and therefore, the response of fineroots to nutrient application would provide better understanding of the forest carbon and nutrient dynamics that will be helpful in sustainable forest management plans. Two fertilization treatments, including (1) F400: 400 g P2O5 (16.5%)/tree and (2) F600: 600 g P2O5 /tree, and F0: control (without fertilization), were applied in an Acacia mangium plantation with a planting density of 1100 trees/ha (3 m × 3 m). The evaluation of fineroot growth across seasons showed that fertilization significantly increased production and subsequent mortality and decomposition. The total decomposition associated with F600 application was 7.95 tons ha−1 year−1, equaling 121% of F400 and 160% of the control. Mortality in F600 was 8.75 tons ha−1 year−1, equaling 111% of F400 and 198% of F0, while production in F600 was 10.40 tons ha−1 year−1, equaling 127% of F400 and 143% of F0. Fineroot production, mortality, and decomposition are seasonally dependent, with higher values measured in the rainy season than in the dry season. Stand basal area increment was significantly correlated with fineroot production (R2 = 0.75), mortality (R2 = 0.44), and decomposition (R2 = 0.48). This study showed that fertilization could facilitate fineroot production, which can then lead to a higher turnover of carbon and nutrients through the decomposition of the greater mass of the fineroots.@@@Carbon cycle

Though sprouting often plays a critical role in oak forest regeneration, there is little information available on sprouting capacity and sprout physiology at the seedling stage, particularly for new germinants. This study compared sprouting capacity and sprout photosynthesis of shoot-clipped germinants of two temperate oaks established in contrasting light environments. We studied the North American Quercus alba and the European Q. robur, both are in the section Quercus and appear to share similar biological and ecological requirements. Sprouting capacity for both species was enhanced under high light availability (29% more sprouts per plant), a response not previously noted for oak germinants. Seedling sprouts acclimated to high light with a 34% decrease in leaf area ratio, a 56% increase in leaf mass per area, and a 49% increase in the light-saturated maximum photosynthetic rate. Though both species appeared similarly adapted to shoot loss, a greater sprouting capacity (29% more sprouts per plant) and plant-level net photosynthesis (73% higher) was observed for Q. robur, regardless of light environment. As naturally regenerated oak seedlings in forest understories often experience disturbance or stress resulting in shoot loss or die-back, our results highlight the importance of the light environment during early plant development.

An in vitro culture began with 200 meristems of each clone, which were excised, disinfected, and inoculated in culture medium. When shoots from these first meristems inoculated reached a height of 3 cm, 100 new meristematic regions of 0.5 cm were isolated and inoculated in culture medium. The other shoots from were inoculated in a rooting medium, where they remained for 30 days. After this period, the plants were acclimatized and used as stock plants for shoot production in a commercial nursery. This process was repeated until the shoots attained an ex vitro rooting rate of more than 80%. After reinvigoration/rejuvenation of clones 02 and 04, the relationship between rooting and the presence of starch and phenolic compounds at the base of the minicuttings was histochemically analyzed. For clone 02, three in vitro subcultures were needed to increase the rooting rate, and for clone 04, only one in vitro subculture was required. In vitro reinvigoration/rejuvenation is a determining factor for greater rooting efficiency of minicuttings of 02 and 04 clones.

Meloidogyne exigua causes the main root disease in this crop in Brazil. Its early diagnosis allows better pest management, reducing losses. This study aimed to identify rubber tree orchard areas infested by M. exigua using remote sensing and vegetation spectral indices—normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR)—generated from the RapidEye® satellite constellation images. Orchards under tapping in Minas Gerais state (irrigated) and Goiás state (without irrigation) were sampled during the rainy season and soil, root and total nematode density were estimated. Although significant interactions between nematode density and vegetation spectral indices were found, none had determination coefficient (R2) greater than 0.31. Descriptive statistics of both orchards did not identify differences between the areas and root or total nematode density; however, nematode density in the soil in the Goiás orchard was 236% greater than in the Minas Gerais orchard, while both spectral vegetation indices were lower in the former. Such differences might be a consequence of irrigation. Pearson’s, Spearman’s and Kendall’s correlations between nematode density and NDVI presented greater coefficients than SR for every parameter in both orchards.

We produced orthotropic shoots by reiteration from strongly pruned trees (5–6 years and 12–14 years, respectively), and harvested cuttings in summer. By HPLC–MS we analyzed the stem base of each cutting for initial hormonal status, and used state-of-the art techniques for a lengthy rooting procedure. Rooting efficiency and orthotropism of the resulting ramets were recorded. Hormonal content varied significantly among cuttings types with differing positional origins on the mother tree. High rooting percentages were obtained in all types; a low original position on the main stem gave slightly better rooting but orthotropism in the ramets was slightly less frequent. Striking differences were found in cytokinin profiles between cuttings from young and mature trees. This might explain a generally lower rooting success in the latter; neither auxin levels nor the auxin: active cytokinin ratio showed any correlation with rooting capacity. Cuttings from mature trees were also less likely to remain orthotropic after rooting. Cuttings that eventually developed into orthotropic ramets were characterized by low ABA, and high levels in a range of cytokinins. The study suggests that active: conjugated cytokinins may be related to the maturation process in trees and that cytokinin content may also relate to shoot dimorphism. These results contribute to a protocol for propagation of orthotropic ramets in a Massart model tree species with strong plagiotropism.@@@Abscisic acid

In 2008, the exotic pest Leptocybe invasa (Hym: Eulophidae), known as the blue gum chalcid, was introduced in Brazil causing damage to eucalypt plantations in many regions of the country. To this end, this study evaluated the susceptibility of Eucalyptus camaldulensis (one seedlot), E. grandis (four seedlots), E. urophylla (four seedlots), and the “E. urograndis” hybrid (E. urophylla × E. grandis) (three seedlots) exposed to a natural infestation by L. invasa in two seasons (winter and summer). The attack on seedlings was classified in terms of severity as healthy (no pest attack), oviposition (only oviposition signs) and gall formation. The results show a significant higher pest incidence in summer compared to winter. Further, Eucalyptus urophylla was the least attacked and 90% of the seedlings were healthy whereas E. grandis showed the highest number of seedlings with galls. The E. urograndis hybrid showed intermediate results between the two species. Differences in susceptibility were observed between seedlots within species. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, which was expected to have the highest incidence of galls, had a high oviposition incidence (60%) and low gall incidence (< 10%), probably due to its provenance. The susceptibility of the different eucalypt families varied significantly with respect to L. invasa infestation, and family heritability ranged from 0.27 to 0.68. The genetic control of L. invasa is possible through the selection of tolerant and resistant material, considering the species, provenance, and family.@@@Exotic pest

While N uptake, allocation and storage has been intensively studied in association with leaf phenology and vegetative growth, influence of reproduction on these key processes is still poorly understood. Therefore, we applied pulse 15N labelling to three fruiting and three non-fruiting trees in a 92-year-old Fagus crenata forest on 18 July and traced 15N content per organ dry mass (15Nexcess) in all new shoot organs from the upper crowns periodically until leaf fall. The amount of 15Nexcess recovered in the whole new shoots in fruiting trees did not differ from non-fruiting individuals, although up to 70% of 15Nexcess was recovered in fruits of fruiting trees but 87% in leaves of non-fruiting individuals. In addition, dramatic increase in 15Nexcess amount in nuts was accompanied by about twofold increase in nut N content. These results indicate that new N uptake from the soil contributed greatly to seed ripening, which in turn resulted in less allocation to leaves in fruiting trees. In non-fruiting individuals, on the other hand, 15Nexcess allocated to leaves was not accompanied by concomitant increase in leaf N content because biomass growth had ceased when 15N was applied. These results suggest that N uptake in the late growing season contributed to internal N storage in non-fruiting trees. These reproduction-related variations in seasonal N cycle have implications for N dynamics in the plant–soil system during environmental change.@@@Allocation

In the central Appalachian region of the eastern U.S., short rotation willow could be grown on the significant amount of reclaimed mine land, which would promote economic opportunities for these lands. The objective of this study was to examine various establishment treatments designed to overcome common properties of mine soils: high rock fragment content that causes planting difficulties and reduced water- and nutrient-availability. Three shrub willow clones (Fish Creek, Preble, and SX61) were planted using six planting/fertilizer treatments. The planting treatments compared a horizontal planting method to traditional vertical planting of cuttings. Fertilizer treatments compared no fertilization to controlled release and traditional fertilizer at a rate of 140 kg N ha−1. After two growing seasons, Preble outperformed the others in both survival and production but the influence of fertilizer treatments was inconsistent and varied by clone. Survival and growth for horizontally-planted cuttings was 46% relative to vertically planted cuttings at 83%. Results of this study will be used to direct future establishment practices for willow on reclaimed mine soils in West Virginia.@@@Salix spp.

In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of salvage logging in post-fire areas on the regeneration and height of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on dry-poor, wet-poor, and peat soils. We used the Poisson generalised linear mixed-effects model and linear mixed-effect model to assess the effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine. In all forest types in post-fire areas, Scots pine and birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) were the most common tree species, accounting for 70–100% of the total regeneration abundance. Salvage logging resulted in significantly higher abundance of Scots pine only on mesic-peat soil. Mean height of Scots pine was significantly lower in stands with larger abundance of remnant living trees. In our study, we did not find conclusive evidence of negative effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine.@@@Scots pine

This study assessed the presence of masting habit in a non-native area, the correlation of annual cone production with climatic variables, and the impact of resource depletion on cone productivity 3 and 4 years after a bumper crop. During 10 years, all cones tree−1 were harvested and counted in three plantations. Cone yield stability was measured via coefficient of variation of cones tree−1. Climatic factors were correlated with stone pine masting. Results indicated that inter-annual variability of cone yield and annual rainfall during 3 years prior to seed maturity, and thermal oscillation 2 years before harvest, were significantly correlated. A correlation was found between cone productivity when reproductive shoot differentiation or when male and female primordia induction occurred, and cone productivity 3 and 4 years later. Individual tree fruit load did not reduce flower induction. The most productive trees will also be the most productive ones in the following years, a finding with practical implications for breeding programs and plant production.@@@Allochthonous plantations

The main objectives of the present study were to evaluate the fine root distribution of Eucalyptus along the soil profile and the vertical distribution of Ca, Mg, S, and K in the soil in response to dolomitic limestone and gypsum application under severe water deficit conditions. The experiment was designed in randomized blocks. Two clones of the hybrid Eucalyptus urograndis (one clone was tolerant to water deficit and one clone was susceptible to water deficit) were used under two crop conditions (with and without gypsum application). Fine root density (FRD) and root length density (RLD) decreased gradually along the soil profile. Gypsum application increased RLD in some soil layers in the tolerant clone. The Ca, Mg, and S-SO42− content of the soil increased in both clones. Both clones showed an increase in wood volume in response to gypsum application. The Ca, Mg, and S-SO42− content of the soil increased in both clones. Both clones showed an increase in wood volume in response to gypsum application. At 46 months after planting, the wood volume increased by 17% in the susceptible clone and by 24% in the tolerant clone. The use of soil conditioners, such as gypsum and limestone, is important to improve soil fertility and root distribution for both clones, especially in a prolonged drought season.@@@Calcium

Profile trench wall method was used to map the root intersection density of six genotypes over a period of 2 years and subsequently root length density was modelled from the root impact data, along with actual measurements from soil cores. Clones of vegetative origin showed higher penetration and proliferation capacity than those of seedling origin. Eucalyptus tereticornis and Eucalyptus camaldulensis showed greater horizontal and vertical spread than reciprocal hybrids. A major portion of the root system was confined in the 0–0.3 m depth and all the genotypes showed decreasing root length density with increasing depth. The estimated depth at which 50% of the roots were concentrated varied between 10 and 30 cm. Water use efficiency of the plants showed a positive correlation with penetration capability thereby suggesting the possible reclamation strategies by identifying potentially deep-rooted genotypes. The modelled root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroforestry systems for better tree-crop compatibility as well as for site-specific selection of genotypes.@@@Root length density

Holm oak populations are seriously affected by a disorder known as oak decline syndrome. However, tolerant plants can be obtained by overexpression of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. The aim of the present study was to define a protocol for transforming somatic embryos (SEs) of holm oak with the gene CsTL1 encoding a chestnut thaumatin-like protein (PR protein). Lethal concentrations of kanamycin (kan) were determined in previous studies, in which SE formation was found to be inhibited by kan concentrations of 100 mg/L and above. Genetic transformation was only achieved when target explants were pre-cultured for one or 2 weeks, with a transformation efficiency of 2%. Transformation was also affected by genotype and was only successful in 2 of the 3 embryogenic lines evaluated. A total of 11 transformed lines (10 corresponding to line Q8 and 1 to line Q10–16) were obtained, all of which were maintained by secondary embryogenesis on proliferation medium (Schenk and Hildebrandt medium lacking plant growth regulators). The transgenic embryogenic lines were successfully cryopreserved by a vitrification-based procedure, thus enabling the lines to be preserved while tolerance tests were performed. The presence of CsTL1 in genomic DNA was confirmed by PCR, and expression of the gene was determined by qPCR. CsTL1 expression was up to 5.93 times higher in transgenic lines than in the corresponding untransformed line. Transgenic plants were produced from transformed SEs, with embryo conversion rates ranging from 2.8 to 66.7%.@@@Holm oak

The suppression of the herbaceous understorey by ploughing, and the use of fertilizers to boost tree growth potentially pose high environmental risks. Managing these plantations as silvopastoral systems (e.g. by introducing livestock and sowing legume-rich pastures) could reduce environmental risks. However, this management shift can only be effective if it is accompanied by an increased complementarity in the use of soil resources to maintain production. We evaluated rooting systems, tree water status and growth, pasture production, soil moisture and nitrate content in the soil solution in a 13-year-old hybrid walnut (Juglans major × regia) plantation under alternative management schemes. The management aimed at reducing herbaceous understorey cover (grazing, ploughing and mowing) and fertilizer usage (no fertilization, inorganic fertilization and legume sowing). Grazed and mowed plots had higher root surface density than ploughed plots. Ploughed plots also showed lower values of soil water (in summer) and tree leaf water potential than grazed and mowed plots. Tree growth and nitrate content in the soil solution was higher in ploughed than grazed or mowed plots. Fertilized and sown plots had higher understorey biomass and lower soil water (in summer) than unfertilized plots. Tree growth was higher in fertilized than unfertilized plots, with intermediate values in sown plots. Managing high-quality timber plantations under silvopastoral schemes with improved legume-rich forages might be a feasible way to reduce the high ecological maintenance costs of these plantations, without compromising their productivity.@@@Grazing

Post-mining reclamation techniques, specifically spoil preparation methods, can influence reforestation success and the trajectory of future stand dynamics. Compaction is a common post-mining spoil stabilization technique but consequently creates high-density rooting media unconducive to forest succession. In the eastern USA, mine operators have traditionally attempted mine reforestation in compacted soils, achieving little success. In 1996–1997, a series of reforestation plots were created on a reclaimed surface mine in eastern Kentucky, USA, to evaluate the impacts of post-mining spoil preparation on plantation development of six native tree species. We conducted follow-up inventories 19 years after planting to elucidate the effect of three spoil preparation methods on tree growth, stand structure, and natural regeneration during the initial period of the stem exclusion stage of stand development. Low compaction reclamation techniques prior to tree planting generally resulted in higher survival and larger trees of all species nearly two decades after establishment when compared with compacted spoil. Natural recruitment and relative percentage of native colonizing species were also inversely correlated with level of grading treatment. Height and biomass growth of plantations in low-compaction treatments approximated those of naturally regenerating stands in unmined forests during similar periods. Study findings indicate that choice of spoil preparation technique during initial stages of reclamation guides forest dynamics up to two decades after planting and that loose-dump and strike-off treatments each promote favorable long-term growth trajectories.@@@Surface mining

The goal of this study was to create land suitability maps for deciduous, coniferous, and shrub shelterbelt agroforestry systems establishment across a wide range of climatic and soil zones of Saskatchewan, Canada. Spatial shelterbelt data and a suite of 50 predictor variables were analyzed using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), fuzzy logic analysis, and GIS mapping techniques. Fifty spatial datasets were used as shelterbelt establishment predictor variables (4 groups): 21 climate (1980–2010 normals), 13 land management, 14 soils, and 2 topographic criteria. A shelterbelt carbon inventory spatial layer was used as the shelterbelt establishment indicator dataset. Using PCA and PCR analyses, the overall importance (cumulative loading: positive or negative) of all predictor variables was determined and used to create shelterbelt suitability maps by means of weighted-sum overlays in GIS. Statistically significant positive correlations between mapped shelterbelt suitability levels and observed mean shelterbelt carbon stocks were used to evaluate the resulting deciduous (4.86 million hectares (Mha) study area; p = 0.0033, R2 = 0.79), coniferous (1.96 Mha; p = 0.0008, R2 = 0.77), and shrub suitability maps (2.06 Mha; p = 0.0002, R2 = 0.83). Additional 8.76, 7.90, and 9.77 Mha were identified as suitable for planting future deciduous, coniferous, and shrub shelterbelt systems, respectively, mapped as above-average or high suitability land. Shelterbelt suitability mapping is a means to delineating and ranking the land across large landscapes.

We addressed this question by following the decomposition of HR in microplots (15-cm diameter, 15-cm height) and determining their contribution to SOC in 10 sites across southeastern Brazil. The experiment was set up according to a complete randomized block design arranged into a 3 × 2 factorial scheme including: HR removal (HR0), only bark removal (HR − B) and HR including bark (HR + B) applied to: undisturbed soil (US) with HR left on the soil surface or disturbed soil with HR mixed into the first 5 cm of the topsoil. We had eight blocks as replicates. Following a 12-month field decomposition, soil samples were fractionated to isolate SOC within the particle-size fractions (PSF) greater and lower than 53 µm. Subsequently, we used 13C to quantify the effects of the treatments in C3-derived SOC content (C3-SOC) within each PSF. For both PSF, their C3-SOC content increased in response to HR − B or HR + B relative to HR0, depending on soil disturbance and HR half-life time (t0.5). For HR − B, net increments in C3-SOC within the PSF > 53 µm increased significantly with HR t0.5, regardless of soil disturbance. Otherwise, the C3-SOC content within the PSF < 53 µm increased with HR t0.5 in response to both HR types, but only for US treatments. Overall, in regions where climate drives fast decomposition rates, on-site disturbance during and/or after harvesting should be minimized to favor the contribution of HR to SOC, particularly within the PSF < 53 µm.@@@Soil organic matter

Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis were the most used species. In view of the need to know the spatial distribution of survival according to the potential species habitat, the current survival was assessed under current and foreseeable future climate change scenarios, using ensemble species distribution models (SDMs). Predicted potential distributions together with 2009 survival data were used to predict the distribution of the survival rate of the two species. The set modelling approach gave very accurate results for the current potential distribution of Q. ilex (AUCtrain = 0.908, TSS = 0.647, Kappa = 0.647) and P. halepensis (AUCtrain = 0.983, TSS = 0869, Kappa = 0.868) and moderately accurate estimates of the distribution of the survival rate of Q. ilex and P. halepensis (RMSE = 0.23). It was found that 25–38% of the Q. ilex and P. halepensis plantations planted between 1993 and 2000 were established in the optimal area of occurrence (probability of occurrence > 70%), but only 12.3% (Q. ilex) and 22.9% (P. halepensis) presented simultaneously an acceptable survival rate (> 50%). In addition, the volume of the environmental space defined by Q. ilex decreased, while that defined by P. halepensis remained constant in future projections under climate change. The potential of SDMs to predict the survival rate distribution of Q. ilex and P. halepensis and to assess the future stability for each of these species has been confirmed. In the worst case, ~ 5% of Q. ilex and ~ 33% of P. halepensis of planted surface would withstand climate change.@@@Afforestation

Herein, we investigated whether the time after restoration determines the similarity between restoration forests and reference ecosystems, and whether the age and width of the forest as well as the surrounding forest cover have an influence on forest restoration. The tree stratum, seed rain, and regenerating stratum were monitored in a reference ecosystem and four 10-year and 20-year-old restoration forests of different widths in southeastern Brazil. We verified that both 10- and 20-year-old restoration forests were like the reference ecosystem in the species richness, diversity, number of individuals, and functional groups of the tree stratum and seed rain. However, the floristic composition of the three strata evaluated plus the number of regenerating plants were lower in the restoration forests than in the reference ecosystem, which may be due to the agricultural matrix where the restoration forests were inserted. We also found that most of the ecological indicators were associated with increasing forest width meaning that wider strips can recover more vegetation attributes. The study indicates that various indicators can be recovered within a decade of active restoration (seedling planting) in the tropics. The regenerating stratum however may require more than two decades to recover. As the restoration was associated with increasing forest width, restoration practitioners should restore wider areas so that more biological groups can be recovered.@@@Ecological indicators

Genetic variation analysis and genetic parameter estimation of growth traits were carried out using 52 families of three provenances, Muling (M), Jinshantun (J), Wuyiling (W), of P. koraiensis at Jiangshanjiao (JSJ) and Qingshan (QS) forest farms in Heilongjiang Province, China. The variance analysis of the multisite test and the type B correlation coefficient of growth traits between the two sites were less than 0.2, indicating that the growth traits of the family had extremely significant GEI, and the growth of families of provenances J and W (experienced colder conditions) at JSJ and QS was significantly better than that of provenance M (grew in relatively warm areas). The main drivers of GEI might be the annual average temperature and frost-free period. The families from provenances J and W that experienced colder conditions might have higher environmental adaptability and superior growth compared with families from provenance M. The family with the highest but unstable volume yield at JSJ and QS was M410 and W010, respectively. While, the top five families with high and stable yields were J085, J097, W037, W045 and J068 by stability analysis (BLUP-GGE) of joint-site.

We used presence–absence data from A. pinsapo and 79 environmental variables and biomod species distribution models to describe the current and future species habitat across the Sierra de las Nieves Natural Park (southern Spain). A. pinsapo habitat was most strongly associated with microtopographic (solar incidence) and temperature variables, indicating climate-driven changes in microhabitat use. Most of the temperature variation among the study site was attributable to topographic microclimates rather than regional temperature differences, such that differences in microhabitat associations occurred principally between north- and south-facing slopes within the same region. The current potential distribution suggests that around 8.7% (56.44 km2) of the study area is highly suitable for A. pinsapo, with 9.7% (62.84 km2) being moderately suitable. Under different global circulation models and climate change scenarios, the net decrease in suitable habitat is predicted to be 93% of the current distribution by 2040, disappearing altogether by 2099. Our findings also show a sharp reduction of potential restoration areas (1.8% of the current areas). Microclimatic variation generated by the topography offers the microclimate-driven locations of habitat suitability which could shape species’ distribution restoration actions and their responses to environmental change. The approach presented here can provide a rapid assessment of the future conservation status of other important forest tree species in Spain, improving our understanding of the vulnerability of endangered species under climate change, and can be an effective tool for biodiversity conservation, restoration, and management.@@@Conservation

And it has been well documented for evergreen species and for deciduous broadleaf tree species. Meanwhile, subirrigation (SI) and fertilization are used to improve the production efficiency of seedlings, however, little is known about how retranslocation in deciduous conifer seedlings is affected by SI or soil fertility. We fertilized Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr seedlings with 50, 100, and 150 mg N per seedling using SI and overhead irrigation (OI). Seedling growth and nutrient status, at both pre-senescence (T1) and post-abscission (T2) moments, and growing media electrical conductivity were measured to (1) explore relationships between foliar nutrient retranslocation and (a) growth, (b) nutrient status, and (c) media fertility, and (2) examined how these are affected by irrigation method and fertilizer rate. Fertilizer rate and irrigation method had little effect on seedling growth, with the exception of root mass, but N, P, and K concentrations increased with increasing soil fertility and both concentrations and contents were greater under SI compared to OI. Foliar N and K retranslocation was lower under SI compared to OI across all fertilizer rates, while foliar P retranslocation was lower only at the highest fertilizer rate for SI-seedlings. For OI-seedlings, retranslocation was unaffected by fertilizer rate, with average N, P, and K retranslocation efficiencies of 71%, 29%, and 55%, respectively. However, retranslocation in SI-seedlings declined as fertilizer rates increased. Foliar nutrient retranslocation directly correlated with seedling biomass accumulation over the growing season (up to T1) and inversely correlated with soil fertility, shoot biomass accumulation during hardening (from T1 to T2), and T1 nutrient concentration in roots (N, P, and K) and stems (N and K). Understanding nutrient retranslocation dynamics for deciduous woody plants informs more effective nutrient management regimes for seedling production under SI.@@@Deciduous conifer

In this study, we compared root development of 5-years-old Quercus petraea and Pinus nigra seedlings planted in plots that had been prepared with different methods, i.e. deep scarification, deep scarification combined with mounding-subsoiling, herbicide and a control without preparation. Seventy-two trees were excavated (36 per species) and their root system was measured by recording points in a three-dimensional space along their roots. The variation of the number of roots with depth and distance to root collar was assessed and analysed, as well as the root projection area. Our results showed that root development was better in the plots with mechanical preparation, for both Q. petraea and P. nigra, when compared to the control. Combining mounding to subsoiling made the roots extending deeper, especially for Q. petraea. A strong relationship was found between root projection area and root collar diameter, indicating the primary effect of lateral root spread on tree growth. The herbicide treatment induced the highest root growth, which raised questions about the potential negative effects of changes in soil properties caused by MSP methods.@@@Quercus petraea

This study investigated the variation in resin canal features in young, 2-year-old, P. radiata. Axial resin canal size, density and relative cross-sectional area were determined in twenty families and ten clones from images of microtomed sections, scanned with polarised light to highlight resin canals. Axial resin canal size was generally homogenous with a mean value estimate of 0.02 mm2, and a coefficient of variation of ~ 10%. Estimated mean values for axial resin canal density and relative area were more variable (coefficients of variation ~ 30%) and lower for clones (0.69 canals/mm2 and 1.13%, respectively) than for families (0.90 canals/mm2 and 1.53%, respectively). Narrow-sense heritability (h2) estimates of the studied axial resin canal features in radiata pine at age 2-years-old were ~ 0.30. Modulus of elasticity and longitudinal shrinkage were moderately correlated with axial resin canal density and relative area, while basic density and volumetric shrinkage were independent of axial resin canal features. The study indicated that there could be potential for breeding P. radiata for resin canal features, with the aim to improve the grade yields of appearance grade products.@@@Appearance grade

Therefore, we annually investigated the crop alleys (AC) and black locust hedgerows (ABL) of a SRACS field trail under initial soil conditions to identify the short-term effects of tree planting on the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its degree of stabilization by density fractionation. We detected a significant increase in SOC and hot-water-extractable organic C (HWEOC) at ABL, which was mainly restricted to the uppermost soil layer (0–10 cm). After 6 years, the SOC and HWEOC accumulation rates at ABL were 0.6 Mg and 46 kg ha−1 year−1, which were higher than those in the AC. In addition, comparatively high stocks of approximately 4.6 Mg OC and 182 kg HWEOC ha−1 were stored in the ABL litter layer. Density fractionation of the 0–3 cm soil layer at ABL revealed that the majority of the total SOC (47%) was stored in the free particulate organic matter fraction, which was more than twice that of the AC. At the same time, a higher and steadily increasing amount of SOC was stored in the occluded particulate organic matter fraction at ABL, which indicated a high efficiency for SOC stabilization. Overall, our findings support the suitability of black locust trees for increasing the soil fertility of the reclaimed mining substrate and, consequently, the high potential for SRACS to serve as an effective recultivation measure at marginal sites.@@@Density fractionation

In Chile, for example, new Eucalyptus globulus plantations are being targeted to poorer, low fertility sites where additional stresses often negatively affect seedling performance during the first field season. Nitrogen-loading during the later stages of nursery production can, however, significantly improve seedling physiological performance on harsher sites by increasing plant growth and nutrient storage reserves for subsequent root growth after outplanting. Maximizing these benefits, and applying the concept of loading throughout the entire crop cycle, requires a better understanding of nitrogen (N) dynamics. Thus, for container E. globulus, considered one of the most important plantation species worldwide, we evaluated the effects of increasing N supply (50 to 600 mg N L−1) on seedling morphological traits, biomass production, root growth potential, and foliar N. After 15 weeks of N application, seedlings showed an increase in all growth variables evaluated up to 300 mg N L−1, whereas higher rates allowed luxury consumption. Modeling growth responses revealed, however, an apparent ammonium antagonism with other macronutrient cations suggests that high rates of this N-form may negate the potential benefits of N-loading, or that other modifications to the fertilizer solution may promote additional growth at higher N rates. Foliar N concentration, which was easily and accurately measured with a leaf chlorophyll meter, showed a gradient from basal to apical leaves suggesting a strong translocation of N in E. globulus seedlings. Our results suggest nursery management that supplies 300 mg L−1 of N through the entire growing season could improve seedling nutritional status, morphological attributes, and growth of new roots, attributes that may improve establishment on low fertility sites.@@@Seedling fertilization

We overviewed deforestation in the period 1975–2018 in the Brazilian Amazon and the projects, techniques, and scientific publications conducted to recover forest in the area by 2019. We used GIS to assess forest loss and a systematic data collection gathered from 12 universities, five major environmental agencies, and an ad-hoc bibliographic survey that rendered information from 405 restoration projects and 152 published studies. The Brazilian Amazon has undergone an accelerated deforestation in the last 43 years, resulting in 20% (788,353 km2) of its territory deforested by 2018. Deforestation rate was 27,033 km2 yr−1 between 1975 and 1987 and 14,542 km2 yr−1 between 1988 and 2018 (1.97% yr−1 of forest loss between 1975 and 2018). In 2018, 41 Amazonian municipalities were classified as priority areas for monitoring and control deforestation and 21 additional municipalities were deemed as areas with controlled deforestation. Our survey identified 405 projects of forest restoration in 191 municipalities between 1950 and 2017. The majority (229) of these projects used seedling planting as the main forest restoration technique. Forest restoration projects based upon agroforestry systems (144), assisted natural regeneration (27), and natural regeneration (5) were also identified. Despite a considerable number of projects and publications, the region still lacks scientific studies that reinforce the choice of best practices for forest restoration, and the information currently available is not enough to quantify what has already been recovered or the potential area to be restored.@@@Bibliographic survey

While we have a basic understanding of the functioning of the gene when coding sequences of specific proteins, we feel the lack of information on the role that DNA has on specific diseases or functions of thousands of proteins that are produced. Bioinformatics combines the methods used in the collection, storage, identification, analysis, and correlation of this huge and complex information. All this work produces an “ocean” of information that can only be “sailed” with the help of computerized methods. The goal is to provide scientists with the right means to explain normal biological processes, dysfunctions of these processes which give rise to disease and approaches that allow the discovery of new medical cures. Recently, sequencing platforms, a large scale of genomes and transcriptomes, have created new challenges not only to the genomics but especially for bioinformatics. The intent of this article is to compile a list of tools and information resources used by scientists to treat information from the massive sequencing of recent platforms to new generations and the applications of this information in different areas of life sciences including medicine.

"1136","Application of different foliar iron fertilizers for enhancing the growth and antioxidant capacity of rice and minimizing cadmium accumulation@@@@@@Received: 08 December 2019 Accepted: 28 September 2020 Published: 11 October 2020 Issue Date: February 2021@@@Iron (Fe) fertilizer can reduce cadmium (Cd) uptake and toxicity in rice, but the underlying mechanisms of Cd mitigation by different fertilizers are poorly understood. Here, pot experiments in rice were conducted to characterize the effects of four types of foliar-applied Fe fertilizer (chelated ferrous Fe, ferric Fe, ionic ferrous Fe, and ferric Fe) at three doses (20, 50, and 100 mg L−1) on photosynthetic capacity, antioxidant ability, yield, and Cd accumulation in Cd-contaminated soil. The results showed that foliar Fe application increased the net photosynthesis rate by 19.3%, peroxidase (POD) by 18.2%, superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 26.9%, and catalase (CAT) by 19.6%, and led to a 7.2% increase in grain yield compared with the control. Moreover, foliar Fe application significantly reduced Cd accumulation by 15.9% in brown rice and decreased the translocation of Cd from roots to other plant tissues. Overall, application of moderate doses (50 mg L−1) of chelated ferrous Fe was the most effective method for reducing Cd uptake (decreasing the Cd concentration in brown rice by 29.0%) and toxicity in rice (decreasing malondialdehyde by 23.2% and increasing POD, SOD, and CAT by 54.4%, 51.6%, and 45.7%, respectively), which may stem from the fact that chelated ferrous Fe was a more stable and bioavailable source of Fe for rice. The Cd concentration in rice had negative relationship with Fe concentration, and the translocation of Cd from root to the other tissues was reduced by the higher Fe nutrition status in leaf, suggesting that a high Fe supply may decrease Cd content by inhibiting the expression of the Fe transport system. These results indicate that foliar application of chelated ferrous Fe provides a promising alternative approach for enhancing growth and controlling Cd accumulation in rice plants. Furthermore, these results advance our understanding of the associations between plant Fe nutrition status and Cd accumulation.@@@Foliar application

Variable-density thinning (VDT) has been proposed as a strategy for accelerating structural diversity, as its combination of within-stand treatments (harvest gaps, thinning, and non-harvested skips) should create variable overstory and understory conditions. Here we report on western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedling and sapling densities in five mixed-conifer stands and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedling and sapling densities in two stands in western Washington at 3,7, 10, and 16–17 years after VDT. Additionally, we report on western hemlock advance regeneration growth and survival in two stands over 14 years. Western hemlock seedling density was highest in the thinned treatment but only significantly so in Year 10. In contrast, the gaps contained significantly more western hemlock saplings in Years 7 and 10 and significantly greater growth of western hemlock advance regeneration through Year 10. Skips embedded within the VDT did not differ significantly from unharvested reserves in terms of seedling or sapling densities of either species. Sitka spruce seedling density was highest in the gap and thinned treatments, but saplings were uncommon in all treatments. Collectively, these results indicate that our variant of VDT promoted patchy, midstory recruitment of western hemlock but failed to recruit Sitka spruce saplings in either stand where it established. Consequently, more intensive variants of VDT may be required to promote midstory recruitment of species less tolerant of shade than western hemlock.@@@Saplings

To test the effectiveness of tissue dehardening curves to represent whole seedling responses, we tested the cold tolerance of 4 conifer species to a range of freezing temperatures, − 15, − 25, and − 35 °C in late March, and − 5, − 10, and − 15 °C in early May. Results show that, after a 30-min exposure to freezing temperatures, needle mortality started at − 25 °C in late March (early spring dehardening) before budbreak activation and at − 10 °C in early May (late spring dehardening) when pine buds had flushed and white spruce (Picea glauca) buds had started swelling. Freezing temperatures delayed the timing of budbreak; increased needle, terminal bud, and seedling mortality; and reduced shoot growth and number of top laterals. White spruce and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) were more sensitive to freezing in terms of needle, terminal bud, and seedling mortality and growth reduction. The effects of March freezing were generally detected in the first year, whereas those of the May freezing were still evident in the second year on the shoot growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Although they seem relatively hardier based on first year post-freezing assessments (i.e., less immediate physical damage from freezing), black spruce and jack pine may have sustained more internal or physiological shock/damage. Our study results support the use of tissue cold hardiness–forcing temperature relationships to assess the risk of freezing damage for conifer seedlings.@@@Spring dehardening

We quantified budburst timing and growth of seedlings of six Ontario temperate forest tree species after exposure to different levels of winter chilling using controlled forcing experiments. Based on chilling–forcing relationships, chilling requirements for the species tested ranged from 1000 to 1500 weighted chilling hours. Our findings showed that the species’ chilling needs ranked from highest to lowest were yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern larch (Larix laricina), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), red pine (Pinus resinosa), red spruce (Picea rubens), and eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Species that needed more chilling to release dormancy generally required less cumulative forcing for budburst. The variations in chilling–forcing relationships among species suggest that they would respond differently to temperature changes, resulting in year to year variation in their relative phenology. Insufficient chilling increased cumulative forcing needed for budburst but only extreme chilling deficiency (< 700 weighted chilling hours) caused abnormal budburst and growth, including reduced leaf and shoot expansion, early and erratic budburst in lower branches and stems, and even lack of budburst after 7 months in optimal growing conditions. Overall, our results suggest that based on climate warming projected for this century, insufficient winter chilling is not likely to occur in Ontario temperate forests in the foreseeable future.@@@Chilling requirement

Reasonable management strategies are vital for their sustainability. In this study, we took a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantation as an example to demonstrate the effects of thinning and mixing on the species diversity and structural diversity of plantations at the stand level over a rotation period (1993–2018). An intermediate thinning (26% of plant abundance) was conducted in a Chinese fir pure plantation in mid-age (2008), and a mixed forest stand of Chinese fir and Michelia macclurei Dandy was established directly. Thinning and mixing greatly increased the species diversity at the stand level, enhanced the mixture, transformed the pattern from regular to random distribution, and made the size differentiation of trees random. Thinning and mixing also greatly improved the mixture and dominance of Chinese fir. M. macclurei had an obvious advantage in tree size and maintained a high mixture proportion. Moreover, the diameter classes of the stands were bimodal. Chinese fir and M. macclurei showed a unimodal distribution of diameter, but other later-coming species with a larger number of individuals displayed a typical reverse J-shaped distribution. Our results suggest that both thinning and mixed planting may promote species diversity and structure over a long timescale, but thinning achieves these characteristics earlier because thinning directly manipulates structure in a way that accelerates stand development.@@@Diameter distribution

This study presents the results of the analyses of selected physical and mechanical parameters of a peat–perlite substrate, in which seedlings of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) were grown during a production season. For each species, the substrate parameters changed throughout the production season, substrate dry weight decreased, whereas its compactness increased with time. Independent of the species, the bulk density and total porosity of the substrate changed or deviated from the optimum range, although the values of porosity were close to maximum and those of density were close to the minimum. In certain periods in the V265 trays with beech and oak seedlings, the substrate was characterized by very low water capacity and excessive air capacity. Compactness measured with a cone penetrometer showed, that this parameter might be used for monitoring the substrate properties.@@@Compactness

In this sense, physiological and biochemical markers were evaluated during the short-term storage of Pityrocarpa moniliformis seeds, a pioneer species native to the Caatinga. Seeds harvested from 25 mother trees were stored in a growth chamber (27 ± 4 °C) or in a refrigerator (6 ± 3 °C) for 360 days. Viability, vigour, reserve contents, metabolite contents, and hydrolase activities were assessed at the beginning of the experiment and every 60 days. Over time, a decrease in germination percentage, germination speed index, and seedling growth accompanied by an increase in membrane damage was verified in the seeds kept in a growth chamber. These alterations were not associated with the degradation of starch and storage proteins, although there was a decrease in the content of non-reducing sugars in the seeds kept in the growth chamber. Therefore, the loss of viability and vigour in P. moniliformis seeds stored for 360 days in a growth chamber cannot be attributed to the hydrolysis of major reserves, but it may be related to the accumulation of reducing sugars.@@@Caatinga

Our aim was to investigate the effect of increasing doses of ARRP on tree, forest floor (litter and root), and soil composition in a 3-year-old Brazilian pine forest plantation. In 2007, ARRP treatments of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 T ha−1 were imposed. Tree growth and needle elemental composition were evaluated in 2008 and 2018; elemental composition of the trunk was evaluated in 2018. In 2017, accumulation and composition of litter layers were assessed: new litter, old litter, first and second sublayers of fragmented litter (Fr and Fm), and the humified layer (H); roots present in F and H layers were quantified (amount and elemental composition). In addition, soil chemical properties at different depths were evaluated in 2008, 2012, and 2017. The application of ARRP improved growth by ~ 16% up to 20 T ha−1 after 10 years. Also, ARRP increased Ca concentration in needles, trunks, roots, and all litter fractions since Ca was a major component of ARRP. There was no change in total litter accumulation with ARRP application, but an increase in the humidified fraction was observed. Root growth was enhanced by ARRP, leading to great changes in root composition in Fr and H fractions. Changes in soil pH, Ca2+, and Al3+ were observed in the 0–10 cm soil layer. Findings suggest that application of ARRP to established pine forests has the potential for improving productivity.@@@Calcium

As plantation growth improves with increasing vegetation suppression frequency, it may be necessary to pre-commercially thin stands to reduce intraspecific competition. The effect of these silvicultural activities for controlling inter- and intra-specific competition to optimize plantation financial performance is relatively unexplored. This study tests the financial performance of several operational mixtures of herbicides relative to sustained suppression of herbaceous, woody, and all non-crop vegetation based on 29-year yields and financial data; pre-commercial thinning was tested to understand whether reducing stand density affected responses to vegetation control. Intensive vegetation control increased financial returns compared to the control and sustained woody and herbaceous vegetation suppression, but it was similar to the operational-analogue treatments. Introducing pre-commercial thinning undermined financial performance of the intensive treatments, except for that of herbaceous control. While 5 years of vegetation suppression increased yields, in several cases the improved yields did not overcome intensive early-rotation costs; the rate of yield increase (plus any stumpage price increase) was less than the discount rate at 5%. On a 29-year rotation, increased discount rates increasingly favored treatments with fewer costs. Pre-commercial thinning increased the proportion of sawtimber, but it did not enhance financial performance of the vegetation suppression treatments.@@@Intensive management

Using recently published data on planted forests by country, we estimated relationships between per capita income and planted forest area that are useful for understanding prospective planted forest area futures through 2100 under various United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-inspired Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Under all SSPs, projections indicate increasing global planted forest area trends for the next three to four decades and declining trends thereafter, commensurate with the quadratic functions employed. Our projections indicate somewhat less total future planted forest area than prior linear forecasts. Compared to 293 million ha (Mha) of planted forests globally in 2015, SSP5 (a vision of a wealthier world) projects the largest increase (to 334 Mha, a 14% gain) by 2055, followed by SSP2 (a continuation of historical socio-economic trends, to 327 Mha, or an 11% gain), and SSP3 (a vision of a poorer world, to 319 Mha, a 9% gain). The projected trends for major world regions differ from global trends, consistent with differing socio-economic development trajectories in those regions. Our projections based on empirical FAO data for the past 25 years, as well as those by other researchers, suggest that achieving the much more ambitious global planted forest targets proposed recently will require exceptional forest land and investment supply shifts.@@@Planted forests

We compared tree diversity, potential timber productivity and estimated net revenues in planted forests of Pinus patula and mixed TMCF species in southern Mexico. These planted forests were 21 years-old and established under similar environmental conditions in abandoned pastures previously occupied by TMCF. Adult tree height and density were similar between planted forests, but sapling and seedling density were reduced in P. patula in comparison to the mixed forest (0.05 and 0.28 sapling m−2 and 0.08 and 0.56 seedling m−2, respectively). The diversity of adults was similar, but that of saplings and seedlings was lower in P. patula than in the mixed forest (saplings: 3.39 and 9.14 effective species; seedlings: 2.85 and 9.59, respectively). Timber volume was similar between planted forests; however, due to higher establishment costs and lower market price, the net present value (NPV) of the mixed forest was considerably lower than that of P. patula. The mixed forest only achieved a positive NPV with subsidies and an interest rate < 5% under a 30% harvesting intensity. To ameliorate biobiodiversity loss, TMCF landscapes require alternative measures; e.g., a supply of a diverse mix of native seedlings, stimulation of the market for native species, compensatory mechanisms for mixed plantations of native species and landscape approaches that combine economically profitable and ecologically desirable species.@@@Mexico

Growth traits, gas exchange parameters and needle morphology and anatomy vary greatly among Picea species, but the instrinsic relationship among these traits has not been well studied for the genus Picea. We thus conducted a common garden experiment to study the relationship for these traits in 13 native and 4 exotic Picea species growing at an experimental site in Tianshui, Gansu, China. Nearly all of these traits were significantly different among the 17 species and most traits were under relatively strong genetic control. The four species introduced from abroad (P. abies, P. pungens, P. glauca and P. mariana) exhibited good growth performance in the experimental site. We found that the growth traits showed significantly positive correlation with branching characteristics. Moreover, the species with good growth performance had a relatively high photosynthetic rate. The correlation analysis based on needle morphological and anatomical traits revealed that needle traits were interrelated and needle anatomical traits might be impacted by needle size due to the increase of mesophyll area and central cylinder area with needle length. Furthermore, the relationship between needle structures and gas exchange parameters may indicate that a higher photosynthetic rate can be attributed to variations in needle structures. In addition, both the cluster analysis and principal component analysis based on needle morphology, anatomy, gas exchanges and growth traits might partially reflect the evolutionary history of the 17 Picea species. Our study represents a comprehensive survey of variation within the genus Picea to date and opens new avenues for exploring the instrinsic relationship among growth traits, needle gas exchange and needle morphology and anatomy.@@@Genetic difference

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of seed size on the seedling emergence and establishment of seedlings of Ceiba aesculifolia in pastures and remnants of tropical low deciduous forest in central Veracruz, Mexico. Three seed sizes were evaluated: small (120–218 mg), medium (219–316 mg) and large (317–414 mg). Seedling emergence rate was estimated, height, foliar production, stem thickness and insect herbivory were measured monthly in the seedlings. Seedling emergence differed significantly among seed sizes. The large seeds emerged at 40% in the pastures and 24% in the forest remnants, while the medium seeds presented 20 and 27% in these sites, respectively. The small seeds emerged similarly in the pasture (33%) and forest remnant (28%) sites. In the pastures, regardless of seed size, the seedlings presented significantly higher growth rates and foliar production, as well as an increase in the percentage of herbivory. At the end of the study, there was no difference in seedling survival between seed sizes or sites. The results suggest that the seed size only influences the seedling emergence, while the growth and responses to herbivory depend on their functional traits to face the environmental conditions of the sites. Finally, the ecological and management implications for future restoration programs are discussed.@@@Tropical dry forest

We analyzed clones of four age groups: seedlings (4–7 years), young trees (38–62 years), mature trees (238–376 years), and old trees (549–700 years). The results showed that during the first 7 years after grafting, the age of the scion donor tree greatly affects branching patterns and leaf morphology of grafted trees. The age of the scion donor tree also significantly affects the growth of grafts in length, albeit to a lesser extent. Grafts derived from seedlings, young, mature, and old trees had different ratios of shoot elongation and branching: weak growth and abundant branching, strong growth and abundant branching, strong growth and medium branching, weak growth and branching, respectively. The degree of needle xeromorphy, the level of apical dominance, and the number of epicormic buds increased significantly with the age of scion donor trees. Premature (late summer and autumn) growth of dormant buds was typical only for grafts derived from seedlings and, to a lesser extent, from young trees. The closer the scion donor tree is to the ontogenetic growth peak, the more elongated and abundant the branching of the grafts derived from it.@@@Pinus sibirica Du Tour

Routine spring planting of bareroot seedlings is frequently unsuccessful in central Europe. In this study, the effects of planting time and a spring-pre-planting application of ectomycorrhiza-hydrogel additive Ectovit and hydrogel Stockosorb on the development of bareroot and container Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings on windthrow area in Western Carpathians, northwest Slovakia were estimated. Survival and aboveground growth parameters during three consecutive years and root dry weight, short root frequency, soil and needle nutrients concentration and ectomycorrhizal fungi root colonization and identification 2 years after planting were assessed. Regardless of planting time and additive, the best developed bareroot spruce (2 + 2) survived significantly better than container spruce (2 + 0), container pine (2 + 0) and especially small-size bareroot pine (1 + 0); bareroot pine was found unsuitable for planting in conditions of planting site. Both additives improved survival of spring-planted container spruce in the summer-drought second year after planting. Container spruce survived and grew significantly better following fall compared to spring planting time. Higher number of short roots was observed in spring than in fall planted bareroot spruce. Neither planting time nor additives affected root dry weight and abundance of ectomycorrhizae. No significant effects of the treatments on pine development were found. Except of K deficiency in container spruce, sufficient or overabundant foliar macro-nutrients concentration was detected. Visual morphotyping of short roots and identification of ectomycorrhizae by DNA analysis indicated inefficient ectomycorrhizal inoculation of seedlings with Ectovit.@@@Planting stocktype

Few studies have addressed important practical issues regarding the use of MJ such as treatment incidence and timing, seedling age and its compatibility with plant nursery practices. We examined if levels of pine weevil damage depend on seasonal timing and recurrence of MJ treatment, and if the observed effects depend on plant age. Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings from two age cohorts (1 year and 1.5 years old) received four MJ treatments: MJ application before winter storage in the previous year, after winter storage but before spring/summer planting, repeated MJ application (both before winter storage, and before planting) or no MJ application at all. Pine weevil damage was evaluated in a lab and field experiment. We found that the timing and recurrence of MJ treatment affected the amount of damage inflicted by pine weevils in different ways, but these effects were consistent among age cohorts. MJ application before winter storage provided the most effective protection, and this reduction in damage was comparable to that provided by a currently used physical protection method against pine weevil feeding. Our results indicated that MJ can be applied in line with nursery practices (before winter storage) and provides adequate protection for two growing seasons.@@@Conifer seedlings

It is necessary to increase the productivity and growth efficiency of current forests and to expand the extension of forest plantations, including areas where drought is the main climatic constraint. Even though researchers are currently working on hybridization programs to improve the quality and productivity of poplar cultivars, there are still large gaps in the understanding of the effects of drought on the performance and physiology of these cultivars. We analyzed the effects of water stress on growth and phenology of eight cultivars of black poplar (Populus nigra), two cultivars of the hybrid P. × euramericana, and one cultivar of eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides). The objective was to identify the cultivars better-adapted to dry conditions in semiarid areas of Turkey. Cuttings of the eleven cultivars were grown under two contrasting watering regimes (well-watered and water-stressed). Tree height and ground line diameter were periodically measured along with phenological traits such as bud break, leaf loss, and infection by Cytospora chrysosperma, a common fungal disease in Turkey. Results from this study may help forest managers select better-adapted poplar cultivars for semiarid conditions. According to our results, we consider that cultivars ‘I-214’ and ‘Kocabey’ may be adequate alternatives, and cultivars ‘Ata-1’, ‘Gazi’, and ‘Geyve’ may not be preferred for planting under water-limited areas in Turkey and similar regions of the Mediterranean basin.@@@Growth parameters

This case study in the Panama Canal Watershed explores the viability of enrichment planting for rehabilitating underperforming teak (Tectonia grandis) plantations, which are common in the area. Two high-value timber species native to the neotropics, Dalbergia retusa and Terminalia amazonia, were underplanted in an established teak plantation at the Agua Salud research site in the province of Colon, Panama. Seedling survival, basal diameter, height, total biomass and relative growth rate were assessed for the two years following planting. In contrast with the widespread belief that teak is a poor nurse tree, both species achieved promising early growth with low mortality in plantation understory conditions. Neither understory light availability nor combined above- and below-ground effects of crowding pressure from teak strongly predicted growth of either species. D. retusa, thought to be more shade-tolerant, performed equally across a range of intermediate light levels whereas T. amazonia, thought to be more heliotropic, performed best at the highest light levels, though light relationships explained little variation in seedling growth. These early findings support the suitability of either species for use in enrichment plantings in established, underperforming teak plantations in the Panama Canal Watershed. Longer-term research is needed to evaluate the potential of enrichment planting to increase profitability and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water resource management in these plantations.@@@Dalbergia retusa

Spontaneous seedling establishment around mother trees, the potential receptors of GM pollen, was also verified. All trees analyzed in this study were identified as compatible for crossing with the pollen donor and their flowering time frame showed at least two weeks synchronism with GM pollen donors. As reported in previous studies, pollination occurred at short distances then declined rapidly within 200 m. The results obtained are consistent with data from other reports in different conditions. In the current study, only two GM seedlings out of 574 were detected at distances greater than 300 m from source (one at 400 and the other at 857 m), in rates varying from zero to 1.5% until 857 m, and null above this. Although effective GM crossings were found in compatible trees around the pollen donors, no spontaneous seedling establishment was observed.@@@Genetically modified (GM) tree

However, traditional methods for determining wood properties are difficult to implement at the scale required for large-scale selection programs. In this study, we used rapid phenotyping methods (i.e., drill resistance (DR) and stress wave velocity (SWV)) for assessing wood quality in a 3-year-old clonal trial containing 125 clonal poplar hybrids. These hybrids belong to interspecific crosses of Populus deltoides [D], P. trichocarpa [T], P. nigra [N], and P. maximowiczii [M]. We estimated clonal variation and correlations among DR, SWV, basic density (BD), and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd). Clonal repeatabilities were moderate for all traits, but were higher for BD and DR (i.e., R2 = 0.45 and 0.46, respectively) than for SWV and MOEd (i.e., R2 = 0.30 and 0.35, respectively). Clonal mean phenotypic correlations were high between BD and DR (rc = 0.84) and between SWV and MOEd (0.87), and the clonal correlations (rg) were 0.90 and 0.96, respectively. Overall, there was a weak relation between BD and MOEd (rc = 0.23 and rg = 0.29, respectively). Results support the use of DR and SWV as tools for the selection of poplar clones oriented to improve solid wood properties.@@@Wood quality

The location of this work encompasses Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. Twenty-four environmental variables are used and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios for two different time periods are studied: RCP 4.5 2050, RCP 4.5 2070, RCP 8.5 2050 and RCP 8.5 2070. The most interesting novelty is the use of 13 General Circulation Models and 6 algorithms (Climate Space Model, Envelope Score, Environmental Distance, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production, Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines) were considered for modelling. Area Under the Curve is used as goodness of fit and building the final consensus map. The global habitat suitability area would enlarge in the forecasted scenarios with respect to the present, although it would be more restricted in 2070 due to the altitudinal shift.

"1157","Delineating patterns of sexualized substance use and its association with sexual and mental health outcomes among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Singapore: a latent class analysis@@@@@@Received: 16 October 2020 Accepted: 13 May 2021 Published: 31 May 2021@@@Background

Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) are vulnerable to the risks associated with sexualized substance use. This is a novel study in Singapore that aims to classify patterns of sexualized substance use among YMSM, and investigate its association with sexual and mental health outcomes.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study among 570 YMSM aged 18 to 25 years old, latent class analysis (LCA) conducted to identify classes with similar patterns of sexualized substance use, across which measures of inconsistent condom use, recent STI diagnoses, past suicide ideation and depression severity were compared.

Results

LCA revealed three classes of YMSM based on types of substances ever used in sexualized contexts, which we labelled as ‘substance-naive’, ‘substance-novice’, and ‘chemsex’. Substance-naive participants (n = 404) had only ever used alcohol, while substance-novice participants (n = 143) were primarily amyl nitrite users with a small proportion who reported using chemsex-related drugs. Chemsex participants (n = 23) comprised individuals who had mostly used such drugs. Those in the chemsex group were more likely to report recent unprotected anal sex with casual partners (aPR = 3.28, 95%CI [1.85, 5.79]), depression severity (aβ = 3.69, 95%CI [0.87, 6.51]) and a history of suicide ideation (aPR = 1.64, 95%CI [1.33, 2.03]).

Conclusions

Findings of this study highlight how the use of varying substances in sexualized contexts may be classified and characterized by different sexual and mental health outcomes. Health promotion efforts should be differentiated accordingly to address the risks associated with sexualized substance use among YMSM.@@@Chemsex

Acid soils are prone to excessive Mn levels that under certain environmental conditions may increase availability and exacerbate deleterious effects on plants. Apart from oxidative stress, excess Mn usually affects photosynthetic apparatus. Nonetheless, some plants are known to tolerate high Mn contents without negative consequences. We carried out a greenhouse experiment with two eucalypt species (Eucalyptus globulus and Corymbia citriodora), treated with four Mn additions in the soil substrate (0, 50, 150 and 300 mg kg−1) for 18 weeks. Before harvest, shoot height and the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were assessed, then leaves, stems and roots were sampled, weighted and nutrients determined. Manganese addition increased height for both species while biomass production remained unchanged, even though foliar concentrations ranged from 600 to 800 mg kg−1 at the highest Mn in soil. High root-to-shoot translocation of Mn was observed, yet—contrary to our hypothesis—photochemical efficiency of photosystem II was barely affected, except for the slight decrease in C. citriodora under 300 mg kg−1 Mn. The capacity to accumulate high Mn in photosynthetic tissues without chlorophyll damage seems to be a feature of Mn tolerant species. Nutritional imbalances such as magnesium decrease due to Mn exposure was observed, but not enough to cause deficiency. Both eucalypt species were therefore tolerant to high Mn concentrations in soil, especially E. globulus, and have the potential to be employed in reforestation/afforestation of lands with high risk of Mn phytotoxicity.@@@Chlorophyll a fluorescence

In particular, oak-dominated systems have experienced a general decline as a consequence of habitat destruction, mismanagement and extreme climate events along with the aggressive root pathogen Phytophthora spp. Here, we investigated the effect of soil improvement through soil biological fertilizers on oak defense against tree decline symptoms associated with Phytophthora for two ontogenetic stages of oak trees: adults and recruits. We examined oak survival and crown defoliation status on 60 pairs of adult trees (a treated tree with biological fertilizers vs. non-treated tree) as well as the survival, growth and herbivory on 30 quartets of treated and non-treated recruits, with and without protection against large herbivores. We used two different liquid fertilizers: OptiPlus (a biological fertilizer with organic N, P, S, Ca, Mg, trace elements (Fe, Mn, B, Zn) and humic fulvic acids) and OptiFer (a biological trace element fertilizer with only Fe, Mn and Mg). Treated oak trees with fertilizers showed lower oak defoliation (0.33-fold difference) than non-treated trees. In addition, trees treated with OptiPlus liquid showed a significant reduction of crown defoliation compared to those trees that received OptiFer treatment (0.68-fold difference). Interestingly, this crown amelioration was more effective in steep slopes, revealing that OptiPlus may buffer the stress generated by shallower and poorer soils. Overall, fertilized plants (particularly OptiPlus) were more attractive to herbivores, probably as a result of the greater content in deficient minerals, increasing their palatability. This study has slightly visualized the importance of soil improvement against oak decline through biological fertilizers and the need to further explore different times and techniques of application. Managers should be cautious with the use of fertilizers as they may increase the browsing impact of livestock and wild herbivores on tree regeneration. It is therefore imperative to improve the resilience of oak trees against oak decline while minimizing the herbivory impact on oak recruits.@@@Biological fertilizers

Introgression occurs via triploid hybrids. We evaluated the fertility of triploid birch by examining pollen viability and seed germination. Pollen samples were collected from woodlands throughout Iceland from 99 plants, including 22 triploid hybrids. The germination of pollen from the triploid hybrids was about one third that of the diploid or tetraploid species (mean values: 9% vs. 26% and 29%). Most triploid plants had a pollen germination of less than 2%. However, some showed exceptionally high pollen fertility (six plants: 11–79%). Microscopic examination revealed normal pollen tube growth and elongation in hybrids with low germination, while other hybrids showed abnormal tube growth. Fluorescence microscopy indicated pollen viability in all ploidy groups, with green autofluorescence from the cytoplasmic contents and red fluorescence from the exine wall. The Aniline test of pollen viability showed that grains with three pores (normal, triporate grains) stained positively, but non-triporate grains were unstained and empty. Germination tests were performed on seeds collected from 246 plants, including 21 triploid hybrids. The germination percentage of seeds from triploid hybrid plants was about 20 times lower than that of the diploid or the tetraploid species (population means: 0–4% vs. 3–41% and 6–54%). The present study shows that triploid birch hybrids are not sterile. Both the paternal and maternal fertility of the hybrids should be sufficient to facilitate gene flow via backcrossing with the parental species.@@@Betula

Cold damage to trees caused by harsh winter conditions is common on many sites in Turkey. Adaptation to climate change has been investigated primarily through the movement of species from warmer and drier climates, such as the Mediterranean P. brutia, to higher latitudes and cooler sites in central-north Turkey. In order to better guide species and provenances movement to new (and often harsh) environments for afforestation, the limits of tolerance to cold and drought should be better known. Thus, we designed an experiment to quantify the cold hardiness of nine P. brutia provenances originating from two different provenance trials in Turkey (Ankara, cold inner site; Antalya, warm Mediterranean site). Branches sampled at the end of January were exposed to cold temperatures between − 5 and − 40 °C. Visual damage observation, relative electric leakage and chlorophyll fluorometry (CF) screening methods were used to assess variation in cold hardiness among populations. Overall, P. brutia can tolerate winter temperatures up to − 16 °C. Even though there were significant differences on cold hardiness among populations, the operational application is limited due to the reduced magnitude of those differences. Measuring CF was the fastest and most easily replicated method to estimate cold hardiness and was as reliable as REL. We recommend that P. brutia should not be planted in cold areas where minimum annual temperatures are under − 16 °C. We also conclude that even though phenotypic plasticity exists for cold hardiness among the tested populations of P. brutia, the observed differences resulted from acclimation to the conditions of the provenance trial sites rather than from adaptation through natural selection.@@@Frost resistance

However, outside its natural range, Northern red oak has to date been insufficiently studied both in terms of silviculture and genetics. To clarify this, we studied the architecture of 92 (pre-) dominant Northern red oak trees in five German federal states using the non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning method (TLS). In addition, individual-based heterozygosity was calculated based on microsatellite data obtained by analyzing twelve potentially adaptive genic (EST derived markers) and eight putatively selectively neutral nuclear microsatellite markers. With these data the individual heterozygosity of the sample trees was calculated. Mean or median branch angles as well as branch angle ranges of first order branches decreased with individual heterozygosity calculated group-wise for all markers (HoAll) and for EST-derived markers (HoEST). Most other tree characteristics, including the number of bark anomalies and mean stem non-circularity and crown characteristics such as crown volume, crown surface area, or mean branch length of first order branches responded exclusively to competition. We conclude that competition, not genetics, is the main driver of Northern red oak stem and crown characteristics. Thus, stem quality and crown dimension can primarily be controlled by silvicultural interventions. The significant relationship between Northern red oak branch angle traits and individual tree heterozygosity was unexpected, and at this time we do not have any validated explanation for this. This issue needs to be further investigated.@@@Northern red oak

Mixing fast-growing tree species in short rotation coppices may show complementarity effects and increased yield. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of species interaction in mixed short rotation coppices with fast-growing Populus spp.-hybrids and the N-fixing Robinia pseudoacacia. Four different Populus-hybrids (AF2, Fritzi Pauley, Hybride 275 and Max 1), planted alternately in pure and mixed stands with R. pseudoacacia were used for the analysis. Height and root collar diameter were measured once a year, over a period of four years (2014–2017). Additionally, in the third year, aboveground competition was surveyed with a terrestrial laser scanner and root biomass was analyzed to assess belowground competition. Soil nitrogen was also determined in order to verify enrichment properties of mixtures compared to pure stands. Populus-hybrids’ stem volume showed no significant differences between stand types in the first year after planting. In the second and third year, however, two Populus-hybrids (AF2 and Max 1) had a higher stem volume increment of up to 3.8 times than stem volume increment in pure stands. This may be related to the fact that soil nitrogen was 39% higher in the mixtures than in pure stands. However, in the 4th year after stand establishment, R. pseudoacacia’s crowns were so massive and broad, that this species was far more competitive than the Populus-hybrids. With the exception of P. ‘Fritzi Pauley’, which showed no significant differences between stand types, growth rates reversed for the other three Populus-hybrids. AF2, Max 1 and Hybride 275 showed up to 75% lower stem volume increment in mixtures compared to pure stands. We assume that, in spite of the initially observed facilitation between the species, the competition exerted by R. pseudoacacia started dominating after 4 years and began to surpass the benefits of facilitation.@@@Short rotation coppice

Nevertheless, it is difficult to predict which sex of P. yunnanensis will be more affected by the combined effects of water limitations and defoliation. In this study, we examined the combined effects of progressive drought and defoliation on water relations, growth, gas exchange and leaf carbohydrate reserves in P. yunnanensis females and males to test whether defoliation alters the effects of drought and and how this response varies between genders. The experimental design included two watering regimes (well-watered and drought-stressed) and two levels of defoliation (leaves untouched and 60% defoliated). Defoliation exacerbated drought stress in females by decreasing photosynthesis, dry mass accumulation and leaf non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration. In contrast, the total biomass of males grown under drought combined with defoliation was not significantly altered when compared to those grown under drought alone. These results suggest that defoliation does not aggravate the drought effects on males. The males presented a high capacity to maintain foliar water status through stomatal control under drought conditions irrespective of defoliation treatment. The conservative water use strategy in males resulted in a gradual reduction in leaf water potential, gas exchange rates and NSC. Our data showed that the different responses of the females and males to drought and defoliation were influenced by plant water status and consequent effects on changes in carbon assimilation and leaf non-structural carbohydrate reserves.@@@Compensatory mechanisms

However, the major challenge is the adventitious rooting ability of high yielding genotypes. In Eucalyptus, large-scale plantations of hybrid clones with enhanced productivity are well documented. However, the understanding of genetic architecture of adventitious rooting traits in this genus is limited. The present study was conducted to decipher the genetic control of this quantitative trait in a bi-parental pedigree of E. tereticornis × E. camaldulensis. The selected parental clones used for controlled hybridization were divergent for their adventitious rooting capacity from stem cuttings. The juvenile shoots of parents and hybrids were coppiced and two-node stem cuttings were harvested and treated with 4000 mg L−1 Indole-3-butyric acid. Phenotypic variation in adventitious rooting traits was documented after 40 days of root induction in parents and 68 hybrids across two settings (March 2015 and April 2015). Significant difference in rooting percentage and number of roots was recorded between the settings. The study revealed a positive correlation between root length and rooting percentage. Broad sense heritability coefficient was the highest for rooting percentage and the predicted genetic advance was maximum for root volume (60.77%). Transgressive inheritance pattern was recorded for all rooting traits and several hybrids registered higher rooting percentage, enhanced root area and volume when compared to parents. These out-performing hybrid clones with superior root system will have potential resource use efficiency and can be deployed in arid and semi-arid zones to enhance productivity.@@@Adventitious rooting

Recent findings on spruce regeneration on abandoned agricultural land showed it to be linked to land-use legacies involving increased soil fertility by fertilization. We argue that indirect drivers like land-use changes from arable land to grassland, which affect soil fertility and vegetation density, could also be involved. We selected a study area where changes in land-use involved gradual abandonment of agricultural intervention and created substantial heterogeneity in forest stand age and species composition. Over a 60-year period, the tree colonization pattern changed from deciduous tree species in 1950–1970 to Norway spruce in the later period. Generalized linear logistic regression models were generated to explain the presence of deciduous tree and spruce colonization in relation to soil and land-use factors. The importance of plant community composition on establishment of tree species was studied by Cluster analysis and unconstrained ordination. Deciduous forest development was negatively related to past agricultural use as arable land and positively related to extensively used grasslands (meadows and pastures) and no soil factors entered the explanatory model. Ecological amplitude of deciduous tree species and differing patterns of agricultural land management at landscape and farm scales are discussed as possible explanations. Spruce regeneration was significantly explained by soil moisture and agricultural use as arable land followed by conversion to grassland. We conclude that spruce regeneration is a phenomenon characteristic not only for previously fertilized agricultural land but also for marginal agricultural land if the management ensures development of dense herbaceous layer.@@@Soil

It is currently present in Minnesota, USA but has not been observed in northern portions of the state where the vast majority of black ash (Fraxinus nigra) trees are located. Unlike other ash forest communities, the black ash forest type occurs in wetlands and is dominated by black ash with few associate species. Because of this, the loss of black ash can result in changes to the hydrological regime and species composition. The goal of this study was to quantify the structure and composition of regeneration 5 to 11 years post-harvest in three silvicultural systems (group selection, clearcut, and diameter-limit harvesting) to evaluate the potential for establishment of other tree species. Overall, regeneration post-harvest was high but variable across all systems. Across silvicultural systems, there was no significant relationships between residual overstory trees (> 10 cm dbh) basal area and non-ash regeneration TPH, indicating flexibility in designing treatments for diversification. Populus sapling (2.54–10 cm) density was significantly negatively correlated to the depth of the soil muck layer. In contrast, a positive relationship was observed between depth of the soil muck and black ash saplings. These findings indicate that specific silvicultural systems in combination with site quality (e.g., clearcuts on high-quality sites with shallow muck layers) may help to promote non-ash species in black ash forests that are threatened with EAB.@@@Silviculture

The frequency-domain EFMs magnitudes are first generated by combining stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and Exponent-Fourier moments (EFMs). We divide the target region to select local frequency-domain EFMs magnitudes, which are planned to embed watermarks, statistical modeling, and extract watermarks. In order to achieve an accurate modeling process, we conduct the comprehensive statistical analyses of local frequency-domain EFMs magnitudes and establish the powerful Beta Generalized Weibull mixtures-based hidden Markov tree (BGW-HMT) model, which can take into account the non-Gaussian distribution characteristic and the interscale dependency at the same time. The Expectation/Conditional Maximisation Either (ECME) algorithm and upward–downward algorithm are successfully applied to estimate the parameters of BGW-HMT model. At the receiver, the BGW-HMT model is used in the design process of watermark decoder. The decoder structure is developed by using the maximum likelihood decision. In order to prove the effectiveness of proposed watermarking scheme, multi-angle performance tests are performed, including imperceptibility, robustness, watermark capacity and time complexity. The corresponding experimental results from the above four perspectives are inspiring. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, our statistical decoder is significantly superior to other statistical decoders.@@@Image watermark decoder

"1170","Complexities underlying the breeding and deployment of Dutch elm disease resistant elms@@@@@@Received: 07 January 2021 Accepted: 03 July 2021 Published: 28 July 2021@@@Dutch elm disease (DED) is a vascular wilt disease caused by the pathogens Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi with multiple ecological phases including pathogenic (xylem), saprotrophic (bark) and vector (beetle flight and beetle feeding wound) phases. Due to the two DED pandemics during the twentieth century the use of elms in landscape and forest restoration has declined significantly. However new initiatives for elm breeding and restoration are now underway in Europe and North America. Here we discuss complexities in the DED ‘system’ that can lead to unintended consequences during elm breeding and some of the wider options for obtaining durability or ‘field resistance’ in released material, including (1) the phenotypic plasticity of disease levels in resistant cultivars infected by O. novo-ulmi; (2) shortcomings in test methods when selecting for resistance; (3) the implications of rapid evolutionary changes in current O. novo-ulmi populations for the choice of pathogen inoculum when screening; (4) the possibility of using active resistance to the pathogen in the beetle feeding wound, and low attractiveness of elm cultivars to feeding beetles, in addition to resistance in the xylem; (5) the risk that genes from susceptible and exotic elms be introgressed into resistant cultivars; (6) risks posed by unintentional changes in the host microbiome; and (7) the biosecurity risks posed by resistant elm deployment. In addition, attention needs to be paid to the disease pressures within which resistant elms will be released. In the future, biotechnology may further enhance our understanding of the various resistance processes in elms and our potential to deploy trees with highly durable resistance in elm restoration. Hopefully the different elm resistance processes will prove to be largely under durable, additive, multigenic control. Elm breeding programmes cannot afford to get into the host–pathogen arms races that characterise some agricultural host–pathogen systems.@@@Dutch elm disease

However, the success of such a migration will be determined by trees’ ability to acclimate to the environmental conditions at the potential new site. This study was aimed to assess the interactive effects of changes in photoperiod associated with northward migration and soil warming on the ecophysiological traits of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) under different carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2]. We examined the responses of foliar gas exchange and seedling cold hardiness after exposing 1-year old seedlings to two [CO2] (400 and 950 µmol mol−1), two soil temperatures (growing season average at seed origin and 5 °C warmer) and three photoperiod regimes (seed origin, and 5° and 10° further north) for one growing season. We found that the CO2 elevation significantly increased photosynthetic rate measured at treatment CO2, photosynthetic water use efficiency, maximum rate of carboxylation and triose phosphate utilization. Some of the effects were modified by photoperiod. Furthermore, the CO2 elevation and soil warming both reduced seedling cold hardiness, as indicated by increases in injury index. The lack of interactions between photoperiod and other treatments (elevated [CO2] and soil temperature) suggests that young jack pine seedlings may have the ability to acclimate to the new photoperiod regimes at higher latitudes north of the seed origin.@@@Jack pine

However, planting trees should be avoided in wildfire prone and drought prone habitats, which are expanding significantly as climate warms across Europe. In favorable habitats, tree planting remains a controversial solution and the risk of using inappropriate material is high in the absence of long-term planning, unfortunately typical of the forest seed and nursery sector. The EU forest tree planting strategy should pay close attention to local land-use issues, to within- and among-species genetic diversity and should adopt relevant, pluri-annual funding schemes and planting contracts rather than letting market opportunities govern the future of forest tree plantations.@@@Mitigation

The infection caused by the ascomycete fungus Diplodia corticola promotes the occurrence of cankers that reduce cork regeneration devaluating the stands. In this article, we tested the hypothesis that the trees are susceptible to the fungus during a limited period of time after debarking. Five mature cork oaks were subjected to eight reiterative inoculations of D. corticola (from the day of debarking to 35 days after) in an experimental plot located in Catalonia (North-Eastern Spain). The time until first symptom appearance as well as the severity of necrosis were assessed for each inoculation treatment. A generalized linear mixed model was fitted showing that the time of symptoms appearance varied among the assayed times of inoculation. In contrast to the foresters-assumed idea of high susceptibility immediately after debarking, earlier inoculations were neither related to higher severity nor to earlier occurrence of canker. This study represents the first approach to this etiological issue in cork oak canker pathosystem.@@@Botryosphaeria corticola

We assessed the effect of age of the mother-tree and the time of explant collection on culture initiation, as well as the multiplication ability and effect of different nutrient media and plant growth regulators on silver birch genotypes. Explants collected from 1‐year‐old trees (66%) and explants collected in spring (64–67%) developed a significantly (both p < 0.001) higher proportion of shoots than those from 15‐year‐old trees (39%) and those collected in mid-summer (31%) and autumn (29%), respectively. In a stabilised culture, the length of the main shoot varied from 1.3 to 7.8 cm between genotypes, and the multiplication rate ranged from 1.0 to 6.8 shoots per explant. Hyperhydrated shoots were present in 17 out of 50 clones, and, among the clones, ranged from 14 to 50%. Cultures on the Murashige and Skoog basal medium had a higher multiplication rate than cultures on a Woody Plant Medium, and the application of zeatin provided better results than 6‐benzylaminopurine. The difference between cytokinin types was 11–29% for the multiplication rate and 21–29% for the length of the main stem. The highest multiplication rate was obtained using a zeatin concentration of 0.5 mg L−1. However, better shoot growth and proliferation had a significant positive relation to shoot hyperhydration (all p < 0.001). Therefore, a medium with an optimal balance between the multiplication rate and the number of hyperhydrated shoots should be carefully selected.@@@Betula pendula

There is a critical need for a rapid assessment tool for forest monitoring and management. This study uses a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to complete a tree height and tree density assessment in a newly forested Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb) Hook) planting (15 sample plots), Shunchang County, Fujian, China (1.12 ha). Images obtained from a Phantom4-Multispectral UAV were used to generate a digital surface model (DSM) with DJI Terra software (0.02 m spatial resolution). Based on the DSM, the individual trees were identified and the height of each corresponding tree was determined. The impacts of factors related to individual tree detection (ITD) and tree height accuracy were also analyzed. For the tree-level, the highest accuracy of ITD for Chinese fir was 98.93% (F-score = 98.93%). Remotely sensed individual tree heights produced an R2 value of 0.89, RMSE value of 0.22 m when compared to a field survey. At the stand-level, tree height assessment yielded R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.12 m, and tree density assessment yielded R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 48 tree ha−1. The results highlight that UAVs can successfully monitor forest parameters and hold great potential as a supplement or substitute tool in field inventory.@@@Canopy height model (CHM)

The viability of this approach relies not only on its potential to offset implementation costs but also on the capacity of native trees to perform well when intercropped with Eucalyptus. We investigated competition for light and nutrients in these mixed plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We compared (1) Eucalyptus monocultures, (2) plantations composed of native species for restoration, and (3) mixed plantations intercropping Eucalyptus with native tree species, in which Eucalyptus replaced native pioneers. We found no evidence of competition for nutrients or facilitation. Native species plots intercepted more Photosynthetically Active Radiation than Eucalyptus monocultures or mixtures. Our results add to the previous studies on these experiments and altogether suggest that well-managed mixed plantations of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species are a viable silvicultural solution for offsetting the costs of forest landscape restoration in the tropics.@@@Competition

We evaluated the changes in the soil CO2 efflux—a proxy for soil respiration (Rs)—for three years following a native grassland conversion to eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil where minimum tillage during site preparation created two distinct soil zones, within planting row (W) and between-row (B). We used root-exclusion and carbon (C)- isotopic approaches to distinguish Rs components (heterotrophic-Rh and autotrophic-Ra respirations), and a CO2 profile tube (1-m deep) to determine the concentration ([CO2]) and isotopic C signature of soil CO2 (δ13[CO2]). The soil CO2 efflux in the afforested site averaged 0.37 g CO2 m−2 h−1, which was 56% lower than the soil CO2 efflux in the grassland. The δ13CO2 in the afforested site ranged from − 14.1‰ to − 29.4‰, indicating a greater contribution of eucalypt-derived respiration (both Rh and Ra) over time. Higher soil CO2 efflux and lower [CO2] were observed in W than B, indicating that soil preparation creates two distinct soil functional zones with respect to C cycling. The [CO2] and δ13[CO2] decreased in both zonal positions with eucalypt stand development. Although the equilibrium in C fluxes and pools across multiple rotations is needed to fully account for the feedback of eucalypt planted forests to climate change, we provide quantitative information on soil CO2 dynamics after afforestation and show how soil preparation can leverage the feedback of planted forests to climate change.@@@Land use change

The major constraint in the regeneration of sandal is the slow, staggered, and poor germination of the seeds. The germination may continue even up to one year. The present investigation focused on the impact of biopriming on the germination and seedling performance in sandal. Fresh mature seeds of sandal were procured from the Nachivayal Reserve Forest, Marayur Sandal Division. The seeds were subjected to 16 biopriming treatments using Pseudomonas fluorescens at 4 concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100%) and 4 durations (2, 4, 6, and 8 days). The results revealed that the biopriming at 100% for 8 days recorded the highest germination percentage (88%) within 21 days with lowest energy period (15 days) and highest germination energy (62.98%). Biopriming at 50% concentration for 8 days was the next best treatment which improved the germination of sandal seeds and the lowest germination percentage was recorded in control seeds (46%). With regard to the seedling growth, the biopriming treatment contributed a significant increase in growth attributes of the seedlings. We recommend the biopriming with Pseudomonas fluorescens at 100% for 8 days as a potential technique to enhance seed germination and seedling growth in sandal.@@@Biomass production

The present study aimed to analyze levels of abscisic acid, gibberellins, auxins, salicylic acid and their role in the physiological responses during development of A. angustifolia seeds in two years of production. Seeds were collected in the stages cotyledonary, II, III and IV during 2 years and submitted to germination, tetrazolium and electrical conductivity tests. The embryonic axes and cotyledons were extracted from the seeds and submitted to hormones analyses. The results demonstrated that environmental conditions during development affected the time when seeds reached physiological maturity and hormone levels. In 2015, seed development occurred under conditions of lower rainfall, cold hours and insolation, providing the formation of larger seeds, favoring a higher abscisic acid synthesis and accumulation, anticipating/shortening seed maturation. The results highlight the antagonistic relationship between abscisic acid and auxins, which acts as a regulatory factor for faster germination. In conclusion, changes in the levels of abscisic acid, gibberellins, auxins, salicylic acid and their role in physiological responses during seed development are linked to climatic conditions during maturation.@@@Seed maturation

The pericarp of intact T. miqueliana seeds comprised an exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp. The exocarp was densely covered with villi and consisted of irregular thin-walled cells. The mesocarp was highly lignified and impermeable, with slender, thick-walled, round and irregularly polygonal cells. The endocarp consisted of spherical parenchyma cells. The water gap provided an entry point for free water in intact seeds. The impermeable and highly lignified mesocarp creates a mechanical and permeability barrier, inhibiting germination in T. miqueliana. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to identify the chemical composition of the pericarp. Identified compounds included phenols, esters, organic acid, lipids, aldehydes, as well as unsaturated fatty acids, which likely play a role in suppressing germination.@@@Tilia miqueliana seeds

Since most studies on growing-season frosts are restricted to the northern parts of the boreal forest or to mountainous areas, their negative consequences on tree productivity at the boreal-temperate forest ecotone is often ignored. We quantified the intensity and probability of growing-season frosts at the boreal-temperate forest ecotone in regard to topographic and microtopographic landscape attributes, which were extracted from airborne LiDAR surveys. In situ air temperature was measured for two summers (2016–2017) with 252 temperature loggers installed in two 18-years-old spruce plantations established in both temperate and boreal mixedwood forests. Growing-season frosts were more intense and probable at the boreal mixedwood forest site compared to the temperate forest site. Still, at both sites, when growing-season frost occurred, air temperature could vary by 4 °C along the elevation gradient of 15 m, often reaching sub-zero values at low elevation while reaching above-freezing values at high elevation. The importance of microtopography on the risk of sub-zero temperatures increased where frost events were less likely to occur such as at the temperate forest and at high elevation. Considering that growing-season frosts can considerably reduce tree productivity, the effects of both topography and planting microsite should be considered when determining where to establish plantations in the landscape and to determine suitable frost-free planting microsites within a plantation.@@@Elevation

However, few studies have assessed the costs and benefits of production in order to determine the optimal pruning design. The concept of a functional crown provides reasonable guidance for pruning, but there is no objective method of determining the functional crown. Semimonthly measurements of leaf traits and photosynthetic characteristics and the corresponding environmental conditions were conducted for young Larix olgensis plantations throughout the entire growing season. The dynamic crown net photosynthetic rate (An) was simulated by comprehensively considering the leaf mass per area, photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature (Tair), vapor pressure deficit and leaf position within the crown (relative depth into the crown, RDINC). The precision (P) was estimated to be 95.5%, indicating that our model performed well in predicting the dynamic crown An for young Larix olgensis plantations. The net primary productivity (NPP) of each whorl of the tree crown was calculated by numerically integrating the instantaneous An. The net carbon contribution from branches to the tree was obtained by subtracting the annual carbon increment from the NPP. The results showed that some live branches in the lower crown contributed negatively to the trunk, indicating that pruning should not focus only on dead branches. Thus, the lower boundary of the functional crown (LBFC) provides a valuable guideline for pruning treatments. Considering that the LBFC will shift upward as the tree grows, we suggest that advanced pruning techniques be applied to reduce costs and minimize labor.@@@Allocation of photosynthetic production

Since P. pseudostrobus is distributed immediately below the lower elevation limit of A. religiosa, it would be a logical choice of species to fill gaps that may be created by the decline of A. religiosa. We assessed the feasibility of upward assisted migration and explored the effect of rain reduction using four P. pseudostrobus provenances in a rain exclusion field test at the border of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in Mexico. Our results show that, although populations were transferred between − 1.4 and − 3.3 °C mean annual temperature, and 30% of the precipitation (− 200 mm) was excluded, no statistically significant differences were found among treatments or populations for height increment (overall average 1.52 m) or survival (overall average 87%). These findings suggest that it is feasible to migrate P. pseudostrobus upward, towards the MBBR border, which also coincides with the sites where A. religiosa is in decline. This may present the additional benefit of discouraging change in land use from forestry to potato production by maintaining a healthy barrier of trees. If assisted migration is not included in management and reforestation programs, climate change could induce significant mortality in the present A. religiosa forest, facilitating expansion of the agricultural frontier toward the MBBR.@@@Climatic change

Some foliar diseases, like leaf rust, produce defoliation at the end of the summer. The interaction between water stress and defoliation is poorly understood. Hence, the aim of this work was to test if defoliation would have a stronger effect on growth, biomass and nutrient accumulation in well-watered plants than in water-stressed plants. The experiment started with 36 Populus deltoides unrooted cuttings, which grew outdoors in pots throughout a complete growing season. Water stresses (flooding and drought) were imposed from early summer when cuttings were established. Defoliation (50%) was applied at the end of summer when plants were acclimated to water stress. We analyzed photosynthetic parameters in response to water stress and biomass, nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation and partitioning at the end of the first growing season. Artificial defoliation produced similar reduction of plant height and aboveground biomass in the three water conditions; but in well-watered plants caused a strong decrease in belowground accumulation. Defoliation increased nitrogen resorption from leaves before abscission only in plants under drought, but it had no effect in nutrient resorption in well-water and flooded plants. Defoliation decreased nitrogen and phosphorus storage in every water condition. The results are relevant to manage poplars in environments with multiple stresses, because defoliation at the end of the growing season and water stress have relevant impact on plant growth, nutrient storage capacity and on the internal distribution of nutrients.@@@Poplars

Besides being cultivated as an agro-forestry crop, they provide mankind with fuel wood, timber wood, plywood, sports goods, raw material for paper industry and recently, they are being used as a potential biofuel source. However, a number of biotic and abiotic stresses reduce poplar yield and productivity. Further, there is a strong felt need of paper and pulp industries to have reduced lignin content or modified lignin composition of poplar wood, which will assist in manufacturing better quality paper using less environmentally hazardous chemicals. Because of the non-availability of resistance donor sources and long generation period, conventional breeding could achieve success in genetic improvement of poplars. To circumvent these bottlenecks, genetic engineering interventions have been applied for poplar crop improvement. With the availability of Populus trichocarpa genome sequence in public domain, now numerous genes and transcription factors governing various metabolic pathways got identified, which can be targeted for genetic engineering for poplar improvement.

Five Abies alba seedling production technologies were tested: (1) bare-root seedling, three years in the open (3/0); (2) bare-root seedling, two years under a shading net (40% of full light), a year in the open (2/g); (3) ball root seedling, two years under a shading net (40%), a year in the open (2/K); (4) bare-root seedling grown in an opening in a Norway spruce stand (3/Pic); (5) bare-root seedling, three years under Scots pine canopy (3/Pin). Silver fir seedlings acclimatized their growth rates to the common growing environment in relation to the seedling production technology used in the nurseries. The height and diameter at root collar were positively correlated with survival. The 3/Pic seedlings manifested the lowest survival and were lower than other seedlings in terms of height and photochemical efficiency. The needle photochemistry of seedlings growing two years in plantation was determined by their earlier acclimation to the nursery light conditions. The production technology determined the ability of A. alba seedlings to acclimatize to the natural environment. Ball root seedlings grown two years in shade and a year in the open (2/K) acclimatized better to the full light environment compared with bare-root seedlings produced in canopy shade, and they are likely more suitable to be planted after clearcutting.@@@Abies alba

In this sense, the Technosols building from materials made or modified by man, such as mine tailings, is necessary for recovering degraded areas. Additionally, the Technosols management, such as subsoiling and liming, increases chances of plants establishment and growth. In this study, a degraded area by bauxite mining with constructed Technosol in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil, was tested under three different soil management treatments: Technosol-1 (Tech-1), Liming only; Technosol-2 (Tech-2), Subsoiling + 200 g of NPK in the pit; Technosol-3 (Tech-3), Scarification + liming + all Tech-2 procedures. In every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed: structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity, ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural regeneration and common in early successional stages. Coverage rates in all treatments showed less than 5% of exposed Technosol and the diversity, ecological group, and dispersal syndrome indexes followed a successful trajectory along 8 years. Tech-2 and Tech-3 presented the best chemical attributes and nutrients in the litter stock, but they would probably last several decades to reach the R-forest attributes. Thus, subsoiling alone or with liming provided the best chemical results for soil, litter, and vegetation performance, being recommended to speed up restoration of degrades areas by bauxite mining in the Amazon.@@@Degraded ecosystems

Lawson was introduced in Chile as a promising species for the diversification of the forest productivity and to optimize the soil productivity in areas where the traditional species have failed to develop satisfactorily; however, the introduction of exotic species in a new environment requires the selection of appropriate source of seeds as a first step for long-term breeding. In this study we assessed growth and survival on 30 Pinus ponderosa provenance seedlots from the Pacific and North Plateau races in the United States established in a common-garden experiment. The study included 3 seedlots from the coastal and inland regions of Washington State, 20 from Oregon, and 7 from California. Seedlings were planted in 2002 in a site characterized by high rainfall and snow. Tree height, root collar diameter, and survival were recorded, and a stem volume index calculated, at ages 1, 3, and 6 years since planting. At age 6 years, the best provenance seedlots from the Pacific race averaged 696 cm3 year−1 for stem volume index and 0.36 cm year−1 for height. The slowest-growing seedlot, of the North Plateau race, averaged 197 cm3 year−1 for volume index and 0.22 cm year−1 for height. Differences in survival were not large, ranging from 85% for a seedlot from interior Oregon to 98% for a Californian provenance. At age 6 years, the average survival across all seedlots was 91%, suggesting good adaptation of the species to the site conditions. The study suggests that provenances of the Pacific race could provide appropriate planting material for forest plantations in Southern Chile.@@@Seed origin

To accurately estimate the Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr.) C stock, the provenance effect on C traits was evaluated using 20 F. mandshurica provenances planted in 2 test sites in Northeastern China. A total of 360 trees were destructively sampled. The results showed that provenance effects were significant on the concentrations and amounts of C for F. mandshurica, indicating that integrating provenance factors will improve the accuracy in estimating forest C stocks. The growth rate had no significant effect on the C concentration, indicating that using fast-growing provenances for afforestation will sequester the most carbon dioxide. The allocation of C concentration and C amount gradually decreased along apical extensions, indicating that there was a balance between C allocation to storage and allocation to growth for F. mandshurica. The geographic factor analysis showed that both climate at origin and environmental factors at test site could srongly influence C traits. Allometric equations were fitted between the C amount and DBH, and the C amount can be estimated by the equation and the DBH, which is easily measured. In summary, our research results increase the accuracy of estimating the C storage of F. mandsurica, provide a theoretical basis for increasing C sequestration in artificial afforestation using fast-growing provenances.@@@Carbon concentration

Britton progeny trial in Senegal@@@@@@Received: 25 June 2020 Accepted: 08 December 2020 Published: 18 January 2021 Issue Date: November 2021@@@With continued global change as a result of land use changes, invasive species and changing climatic patterns, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the adaptability of Senegalia senegal provenances to maximize resilience in managed and natural populations of this species. The objective of this study is to investigate Senegalia senegal genotypic differences in water use efficiency (WUE) measured by stable 13C isotope composition in foliage according to their ploidy levels. Secondary objectives are to discuss inherent adaptive variation related to soil pH, survival, growth indexes, gum arabic yield and WUE within provenance in the climate change context. A Senegalia senegal progeny trial, in Dahra, Senegal was used in this study: 443 adult trees consisting of 60 families nested within 4 provenances were assessed in this study. Results showed significant differences in gum yield among provenances (P = 0.0002) and families (P < 0.0001). Diamenar and Ngane provenances showed overall similar annual gum yield despite a lower tree survival rate of Ngane than Diamenar. Growth traits, especially stem volume index and crown area index were larger on Ngane provenance, which also displayed significantly higher foliar WUE and lower leaf area index (LAI) than the other provenances. WUE was positively correlated with gum yield (P = 0.0302), but the coefficient of determination was only 2%. Foliar δ13C varied significantly (P < 0.0001) between diploids (− 27.91‰) and polyploids (− 27.12‰). However, within each provenance no significant difference was found. Only 15% of isotope compositions could be explained by ploidy level variation. Differences found in growth and gum yield may be attributed to genotype-specific variation. However, a significant correlation between soil pH and tree survival rate was found (P = 0.0051; r = 0.60). This study confirmed a possible improvement of the gum arabic sector through genotype based selection. Ngane and Diamenar seem to be more profitable to grow in Dahra than the other tested provenances. Future research should investigate the effect of soil pH, other soil physical and chemical properties, and management activities to improve site quality on tree survival and gum yields among provenances. Further, more research is needed to clarify inherent traits underlying drought tolerance in the field and gum yield performance.@@@Provenances

"1191","Perceptions of land managers towards using hybrid and genetically modified trees@@@@@@Received: 20 April 2021 Accepted: 08 November 2021 Published: 26 November 2021@@@Hybridization and genetic modification are potential methods for incorporation of stress tolerance being explored to support some at-risk tree species. However, many concerns, both ecological and economic, have been identified in using these biotechnologies, such as potential for invasiveness or high cost. There is limited information on perceptions towards hybrid and genetically modified (GM) trees, particularly from individuals responsible for widescale tree management. An online survey was administered to land managers in Indiana, USA to gauge perceptions to hybrid and GM trees, and current hybrid tree use. Land managers had stronger concern for ecological, rather than economic, issues, with potential for invasiveness being strongest. Agreement was highest for using the tree types for conservation and restoration of at-risk species and production purposes. However, perceptions varied by characteristics such as concern type, age, and land type managed. Ecological concern and land type managed most strongly predicted hybrid use. Overall, the majority of land managers agreed, rather than disagreed, with a variety of potential hybrid and GM tree advantages and purposes. Thus, results indicate that if these biotechnologies are deemed appropriate for supporting at-risk species, the majority of land managers in Indiana might be agreeable to such recommendations from researchers. However, it was also clear that despite this, most respondents concurrently had strong ecological concerns about suitability as a native species replacement. To address this, it is essential that these tree types be thoroughly vetted, and land managers be actively engaged in the process, as this population would ultimately be responsible for any widescale implementation of hybrid and GM trees.@@@Biotechnology

Medium and long-term control of this pest can be improved by using resistant or less susceptible cultivars and hybrid clones. In addition, little is known about the local patterns of dispersal of the pest. We obtained data from trees of 3 chestnut species and 27 hybrid clones in a field trial in NW Spain with the aim of evaluating the susceptibility of the material to the gall wasp and identifying possible drivers of local spatial dispersal. In the first 3 years of the invasion by D. kuriphilus, the number of trees attacked and the number of galls on each tree were spatially clustered. Tree height significantly predicted both variables, suggesting that gall wasps may use visual cues to locate suitable host trees, at least in the early stage of invasion. Assessment of the susceptibility of hybrid clones/pure species must take concurrent indicators of infestation levels into account. We suggest the use of indices involving galls on shoots because these enable good assessment of the damage to chestnut trees. The study findings add to existing knowledge on the susceptibility of hybrid chestnut clones. We report, for the first time, two hybrid clones resistant to the pest and one hybrid clone which exhibited consistently low values for all of the indicators of infestation level. The results have important implications regarding selection of plant material for use in afforestation in Spain, where the current high rate of chestnut planting is expected to continue.@@@Chestnut trees

Fortunately, the genetic diversity in many of the affected species also includes some individuals and populations with genetic resistance. Over the last 50 years, applied resistance programs have been undertaken in a range of tree species in the U.S. and resistant parent trees have been selected, tested in seedling inoculation trials and in field trials, selections placed into seed orchards, and the resulting seed used for reforestation and restoration. Both major gene resistance (MGR) and quantitative resistance (QR) have been documented in these resistance programs. However, for each resistance program the question arises whether the resistance will be durable, permitting the species to be used in managed plantations, urban plantings or in native forest restoration over the long-term. Field plantings to-date indicate that in some cases virulence to MGR can arise relatively quickly and QR appears to offer the best opportunity for durability. Ultimately, more time and plantings will be needed to discern if resistance is durable in affected tree species. Changes in climate may alter dynamics that could influence durability of resistance. However, even in the case of virulence to MGR, the pathogen or pest may not spread throughout the range of plantings, and genetic resistance will likely continue to be an invaluable tool for species affected by diseases and pests.@@@Disease and pest resistance

It is therefore necessary to continue developing technologies to support vegetative propagation activities that consider the diverse genetic resources and their optimal production environments. This study aimed to investigate the influence of mini-tunnel use in the clonal mini-garden (MG) and greenhouse (GH) environments on the survival and rooting of mini-cuttings of three Eucalyptus species and a Corymbia species under subtropical climate conditions across the four annual seasons. A factorial experimental scheme was adopted with two environments for stock plants [MG with mini-tunnel (MGWT) and without mini-tunnel (MGOT)], and two rooting environments [GH with mini tunnel (GHWT) and without mini-tunnel (GHOT)]. We found that the use of a mini-tunnel did not influence mini-cutting survival, and all species exhibited superior performance during cold seasons. Eucalyptus mini-cuttings had high rooting under average temperatures of 23.9 °C (GHWT), which occurred in autumn. Conversely, the rooting of Corymbia mini-cuttings was enhanced in winter, in environments with average temperatures of 19.55 °C (MGWT and GHWT). Mini-tunnels altered the clonal production microenvironment, thereby enhancing adventitious rooting. For Eucalyptus, their use is recommended in the GH in autumn and winter. For clonal production of Corymbia, mini-tunnel use is recommended in both the clonal MG and GH.@@@Stock plant

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the growth, yield and stem form of Khaya grandifoliola C. DC. and Khaya ivorensis A. Chev. established in successional agroforestry systems and in mixed plantations of both species. A randomized block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1) mixed plantation of African mahoganies with elimination of regenerating community by herbicide application; (T2) mixed plantation of African mahoganies with selective management of regenerating community; (T3) agroforestry system including African mahoganies with elimination of regenerating community, through mowing operations (non-selective); and (T4) agroforestry system including African mahoganies with selective management of regenerating community. The results shown a higher growth rate of both Khaya species in T1, especially in relation to T2, possibly due to the more effective herbicide control of the dominant invasive species. The structural complexity, diversity and pruning regime of the regenerating plants in the T4 treatment possibly caused positive benefits in the Khaya trees growth. It is possible that Khaya trees captured part of the fertilizer intended for the food crops, although this effect is more pronounced for K. ivorensis. The stemwood volume stocks in T1 and T4 treatments were similar for both species. The total mean annual increments of volume at 58 months were: 3.3 m3 ha−1 year−1, 1.3 m3 ha−1 year−1, 2.2 m3 ha−1 year−1, and 2.8 m3 ha−1 year−1, for the T1 to T4, respectively. K. grandifoliola had higher height and DBH growth rates than K. ivorensis. However, K. ivorensis trees produced straighter stems, with desirable use to sawmilling.@@@Stemwood production

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of phosphorus fertilization on the initial growth of Pinus taeda genotypes submitted to glyphosate subdoses applied during two growing seasons, warm and cold. Four experiments were conducted in an open area using 10-L pots, two in the warm season (during 180 days after application on Genotypes 1 and 2) and two in the cold season (during 81 days after application on Genotypes 3 and 4). The treatments consisted of a 2 × 4 factorial scheme, with presence or absence of phosphorus fertilization (25.2 kg ha−1 P2O5) and four subdoses of glyphosate (0, 72, 144 and 288 g ha−1 acid equivalente), using five replicates. For warm season, glyphosate subdoses provided a stimulatory effect on the plant growth of both P. taeda genotypes independently of the fertilization condition. The supplementary phosphorus fertilization increased plant growth characteristic in both warm and cold season, regardless of the exposure to glyphosate subdoses. However, the plant response is dependent on the genotype. Glyphosate subdoses did not negatively affect P. taeda genotypes growth at both experimental seasons, regardless of phosphorus fertilization.@@@Pinus taeda

However, we lack empirical data on how plant functional traits of different plant life forms respond to environmental factors. We studied the influence of environmental conditions on the distribution of plant functional traits in a Quercus wutaishanica forest with the aim of exploring the patterns of functional traits across different life forms and determining the driving factors of functional trait variation at fine spatial scales. We collected data on environmental factors (soil nutrients and soil moisture, canopy variables, topography) of 70 20 m × 20 m plots. Leaves were harvested from 26 species (4 tree species, 7 shrub species and 15 herbaceous species), and community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values for leaf area (LA), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf carbon content (LCC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and leaf potassium content (LKC) were calculated. We also measured the height (H) of plants. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in controlling plant functional traits was quantitatively assessed using redundancy analysis (RCA). Regression was used to determine relationships between CWM trait values and environment variables. We found that plant functional traits varied with life forms of plants. LA, LMA and LCC of trees were greater than those of the understory, whereas LNC, LPC and LKC of herbaceous were greater than those of trees. Responses of plant functional traits to environmental factors varied with different life forms. The combined effect of canopy, topography and soil factors had a greater impact on plant functional traits in understory layer than tree layer. General linear models showed that openness is the main factor affecting various functional traits of undergrowth plants, and the relationship between the element content in leaves of herbaceous plants and environmental factors is greater than that of shrub plants. The strong correlation of plant functional traits and environmental factors at fine spatial scales indicates that Q. wutaishanica forests have high spatial variability. Considering the variation of traits in different life form of plants and their interactions with biotic factors, it provides further insights into ecological mechanisms of shaping plant communities and driving plant community dynamics.@@@Plant functional traits

In this study, selected and native forest family seedlots of E. dunnii were evaluated in 17 open-pollinated progeny trials located in Australia, Uruguay, China, Argentina, and Spain for diameter at breast height and total height between the ages of 1 and 7 years. The generality of the factor analytic approach was extended to accommodate unbalance in treatment effects and traits, by modelling each dimension of the genotype covariance matrix as a unique combination of location, age, and trait. Genetic correlations between the two growth traits, between trials and between ages were generally high with only five trials exhibiting average trial-trial correlations below 0.7, indicating genotype by environment interactions were low. Estimated individual seedlot repeatability varied from 0.04 to 0.18 for both traits. The results of this study show that selection and deployment across multiple trials within Australia, Uruguay, China, and Argentina is possible from a single breeding program of E. dunnii, however some environments will require further investigation to determine the drivers of the observed GxE.@@@Eucalyptus dunnii

Under current and future conditions, the potentially suitable areas for this species were predicted using MaxEnt modelling from known successful plantings of E. grandis in China. The dominant environmental factors affecting the distribution of E. grandis and ecological similarities between the species’ natural distribution in Australia and the suitable areas in China were analysed. Results show that the majority of the highly suitable areas identified for E. grandis in China are concentrated in the Sichuan Basin and southeastern hilly regions. Under future climate scenarios, the most suitable area for E. grandis is expected to increase through to the 2070s. The distribution of suitable areas in the Sichuan Basin are predicted to expand eastward to lower elevations, and suitable areas in China’s southeastern hilly regions would move to areas experiencing high solar radiation and lower seasonal temperature variances. The dominant ecological factors affecting the distribution of E. grandis were found to be: solar radiation, altitude, seasonal temperature and precipitation variance, maximum temperature of the warmest month, annual mean temperature, slope, isothermality, soil available water content, precipitation in the driest quarter and mean diurnal temperature range. Collectively, these factors account for over 85.1% of the variation in suitable areas. Compared with the species’ natural distribution in Australia, suitable areas in China feature higher precipitations during the driest quarters; a condition favourable to rapid growth of E. grandis.@@@Species distribution

Since carbon trading relies on the accurate quantification of carbon stocks, allometric equations are urgently needed to derive above-ground dry biomass (AGB) from easily measured variables. Few allometric equations have been published for regenerating secondary forests in Southeast Asia. This study established new allometric equations, to determine AGB and carbon in regenerating secondary forests on shifting cultivation fallows in northern Thailand. To develop the equations, data were collected from 78 trees (136 felled individual stems, including coppices) ranging in size from 1 to 32.9 cm diameter at breast height (D). The dependent variable was AGB. The independent variables were D, tree height (H) and wood density (WD). Wood density varied significantly among species (p < 0.05). Consequently, including WD in the function D2H × WD predicted AGB most accurately, compared with other functions that excluded it. Mean carbon concentration in stems, branches, and leaves was 44.84% ± 1.63 of dry mass, but it varied significantly among tree species (p < 0.05). The new allometric equation revealed that tree ABG was highest in secondary forest, followed by the 7-year-fallow and the 4-year-fallow: 105.3, 38.3 and 10.3 Mg ha−1, respectively, while above-ground carbon was 47.7, 17.4, and 4.6 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Natural regeneration accumulated carbon slower than reported for active restoration, suggesting that managed restoration is preferable to passive regeneration on fallows in northern Thailand. The allometric equations, derived from this study, can be used to accurately determine tree ABG and carbon storage in regenerating secondary forest, with higher precision than has hitherto been possible, thus satisfying the monitoring requirements of REDD+ and other carbon-trading schemes.@@@Aboveground biomass

As a result, many forests around the world have suffered massive mortality due to extreme droughts. Therefore, it is important to understand the potential adjustments of dominant woody species of temperate forests to climate change. The objective was to show in seedlings inhabiting the most contrasting habitats, forest types, and precipitation regimes the relevance of species-specific and intra-specific adaptive trait variation. Ecophysiological differences between seedlings collected from distinct humid and dry provenances of Nothofagus pumilio and N. dombeyi in northern Patagonia were assessed using common garden and water stress manipulative experiments. Levels of genetic diversity and divergence were evaluated with microsatellite analysis. Seedlings from humid provenances of both species showed increased growth, and leaf traits differed significantly between N. dombeyi provenances. Studied species behaved differently under water stress, isohydric for N. dombeyi and anisohydric for N. pumilio, while no intraspecific differences were measured in the regulation of water status. Humid provenance of N. dombeyi had higher genetic diversity than the dry one, whereas those of N. pumilio were similarly diverse. Yet, low but significantly different from zero genetic divergence was measured between provenances of the latter. Our results show species-specific responses to water stress and that adaptive variation at distinct provenances has a genetic basis that is maintained despite potential gene flow. The strategy of using seedlings from ""regional admixture provenancing"" is suggested for long-term management of vulnerable taxa to desiccation as the mesic N. dombeyi.@@@Adaptive management

Despite the high demand for this nut, the species is mostly harvested from natural forests, because the time elapsed until the trees come into production hinders advances toward a more intensive cultivation. The grafting technique has been used to favor an earlier production in native Mediterranean habitats. In Chile, stone pine has been recently included in orchards. The objective of this study was to assess the initial performance in terms of growth, entry into production and cone yield of three grafting trials of the species established in Chile; two of the trials included nursery-grafted plants and the other, in situ grafting of P. pinea on a 3-year-old P. radiata plantation. An earlier entry into production and a higher number of female strobili and 1-year-old conelets (up to 2.9 times) were found in nursery-grafted plants compared with control seedlings. Growth was higher in trees in situ grafted onto radiata pine than in seedlings; eight years after grafting, the trees had achieved reproductive maturity, 67% had on average three cones per tree, and the presence of female strobili and 1-year-old conelets was 6.6 and 15.6 times higher than in seedlings, respectively. Radiata pine could be a feasible rootstock for either in-nursery or in situ stone pine grafting.

Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is well suited to carbon forestry due to its rapid growth and long-lived decay-resistant heartwood. We sought to identify redwood cultivars (clones) suitable for afforestation and rapid growth on pasture sites. Our common garden experiment replicated at three sites tested performance of 32 cultivars and a commercial seedlot. After four growing seasons, the tallest cultivar on the two more productive sites measured 6.1 m and 5.2 m and average heights were 3- and twofold that of the least productive site. Seedling heights ranked intermediate, being outperformed by ≥ 50% of the cultivars. Height growth differed significantly among cultivars. Compared to the seedlings, the top three cultivars averaged 15–18% greater height after four growing seasons at each site. This translated to stemwood volume gains of 106% at the best site and 68% at the second best site. There was relatively low—yet statistically significant—G × E interaction, indicating that redwood cultivars can be expected to rank consistently for growth across a range of different pasture sites. However, there may be minor benefits to specific cultivar-site matching especially under suboptimal conditions such as under partial shade on poorer sites. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of elite cultivars for rapid afforestation of pasture sites.@@@Forest establishment

(‘ōhi‘a) is the most abundant native forest tree in Hawai‘i and a keystone species of cultural, ecological, and economic importance. ‘Ōhi‘a forests, particularly on Hawaiʻi Island, are being severely impacted by Rapid ‘Ōhi‘a Death (ROD), which is caused by the fungal pathogens Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia. ROD is characterized by branch dieback, crown wilting, and mortality. Initial disease resistance screening of four varieties of M. polymorpha with C. lukuohia demonstrated that varieties may differ in susceptibility. Several survivors of field or screening-based infections still exist, providing strong impetus for the establishment of the ‘Ōhiʻa Disease Resistance Program (ʻŌDRP). Here, we outline a framework for guiding the ʻŌDRP throughout the process of identifying and developing ROD resistance in M. polymorpha and, possibly, all Hawaiian Metrosideros species. Core ʻŌDRP projects include: (1) evaluating and operationalizing methods for greenhouse-based production and screening of test plants; (2) greenhouse screening of seedlings and rooted cuttings sampled from native Metrosideros throughout Hawaiʻi; (3) establishing field trials to validate results from greenhouse assays; (4) understanding environmental and genetic drivers of resistance to characterize the durability of resistance to ROD; (5) developing remote sensing and molecular methods to rapidly detect ROD-resistant individuals; and (6) conducting breeding trials to improve the degree and durability of ROD resistance. Ultimately, the ʻŌDRP seeks to produce ROD-resistant material for the perpetuation of M. polymorpha across Hawai‘i, with the goal of preserving the ecology, culture, and communities that are dependent on this tree species.@@@Metrosideros polymorpha

Willd.) and its implications for interploidy pollination@@@@@@Received: 01 February 2021 Accepted: 02 December 2021 Published: 03 February 2022@@@Polyploidy is an important mechanism in angiosperm diversification and evolution. Polyploidization can lead to speciation when the chromosome doubling prevents interbreeding between coexisting cytotypes. In the case of Acacia senegal, different ploidy levels have been reported but the degree and impact of interploidy gene flow in natural populations is not yet resolved. This paper addresses the aspect by characterizing the genetic differentiation among ploidy levels and identifying prezygotic reproductive barriers against interploidy cross-pollination. We genotyped 293 individuals from 10 populations across Senegal using eight microsatellite markers. To study potential pre-zygotic reproductive barriers between diploids and polyploids, we compared the flower morphology and phenology between even-aged diploid and tetraploid trees from a common garden trial that consisted of four different populations originally selected in the natural distribution area of the species in Senegal. The analysis revealed variation among populations in the frequency of polyploids with common co-occurrence of the ploidy levels. The microsatellite markers revealed genetic differentiation between polyploid and diploid trees, and the floral studies identified differences that can act as prezygotic reproductive barriers: tetraploid trees had bigger polyads and stigma cup size compared to diploid trees. Also, polyploid trees on average flowered 9 days earlier than diploids although with overlaps in flowering time. Our results suggest that gene flow among cytotypes of A. senegal is limited and that interploidy pollination is likely to be restricted by differences in flower phenology and morphology.@@@Genetic differentiation

Rich, is distributed around the shores of the eastern Mediterranean in Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. The most anamolous aspect of its distribution is its presence in two patches in the Black Sea Region, approximately 500 km to the north of its main distribution in Turkey. Cuneiform tablets speak of an area which was turned into a “land of cedar” during the Hittite era, suggesting that the two patches might have been planted at that time. Genetic studies agree that these two patches originated at a later date than the cedars further south. Here, we make use of another means to test the hypothesis that the northernmost distribution of the cedar of Lebanon was due to reforestation during the mid-Holocene period. We determine distributional patterns for the species using a maximum-entropy algorithm and identify the most important environmental factors in shaping its distribution. We project the distribution of the species under the climatic conditions of the present, the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum. We find the distribution range of the cedar of Lebanon to have shifted over time, encompassing western and southern Anatolia in the Last Glacial Maximum, then shrinking and retracting to the western Anatolia range in the mid-Holocene. The current range of the species was arrived at after the Holocene period. The projections support the possibility that the remnant forests in northern Turkey could have been created through reforestation, and that the Hittite myth may be substantiated.@@@Cedar of Lebanon

The effects of seedling form on the performance of multi-cropped and monoculture plantings of northern red oak and shortleaf pine seedlings were quantified to test the hypotheses that: (1) multi-cropping northern red oak and shortleaf pine seedlings would lead to increased survival and growth of these species, and (2) that the productivity and overall success of mixed oak-pine plantations can be influenced by seedling morphology. Four different form classes of 1–0, bareroot northern red oak seedlings (Short:Thin, Short:Thick, Tall:Thin, and Tall:Thick) were planted with 1–0, bareroot shortleaf pine seedlings at a 2.44 m spacing, with 0.31 m between each planted oak and pine. Adjacent monocultures of shortleaf pine and all form classes of northern red oak were also planted for comparison. Measurements of seedling performance over six years revealed no significant differences in shortleaf pine and northern red oak survival and growth among multi-cropped and monoculture treatments. In contrast, mean height and mean basal diameter in Tall:Thick northern red oak seedlings were significantly greater than in the remaining three northern red oak form classes, regardless of multi-cropping treatment. Survival did not differ among form classes (p > 0.05). These results suggest that seedling morphology was more important than the effects of multi-cropping early on in the development of these plantations, and that further testing of the effects of form class across different multi-cropped species is warranted.@@@Artificial oak regeneration

This study evaluated the effects of forest industry residue application on soil attributes, on forest floor amounts, and on growth and nutrition of Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine). Six rates (0, 14, 25, 49, and 60 T ha−1) of residue (boiler ash and cellulose sludge mixture) were applied to P. taeda stands on a low fertility soil. Seven years after application, trees were harvested for wood volume, wood biomass, canopy mass, and nutrient composition. Wood density was determined along the trunk length. Soil samples from 0–10 to 10–20 cm depths were collected for evaluating chemical attributes. Although residue application only resulted in small increases in soil Ca and P availability, high yield enhancements were observed with no compromise to wood density. Maximum growth response was obtained with the 49 T ha−1 residue application. This rate enhanced trunk volume from 117 to 250 m3 ha−1, total biomass from 76 to 127 T ha−1, and total C from 34.5 to 57.2 T ha−1. Residue application decreased Mn content in all biomass compartments, and values above 193.5 (needles) and 26.2 mg kg−1 (bark) defined low annual growth increases. Residue application also decreased Al, Fe, S, B, Ca, and P concentrations in branches or needles. Forest floor was enhanced by residue amendment, which increased C sequestration by 7 T/ha. Forest sustainability practices can be enhanced by applications of industrial residues while improving tree yield and nutrition.@@@Southern Brazil

This study used a dendrochronological approach to analyze the annual radial increase and basal area increments (BAI) of Pinus contorta in relation to successive extreme drought events and their influence on tree susceptibility to Sirex noctilio attack. Based on climatic variables (mean temperatures and mean monthly rainfall), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index was determined and used to characterize drought events and their succession from 1993 to 2012. Annual radial increase was measured on cores from healthy trees and trees attacked by S. noctilio. Growth before, during and after each drought event was recorded, and resistance, recovery and resilience indexes were calculated from BAI. The BAI values of healthy and attacked trees differed as from the drought event that occurred in 2002 (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.05). Healthy and attacked trees had similar resistance to the first characterized drought event of 1998–1999, while attacked trees had lower resistance after the successive drought events analyzed (one-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.05). Healthy trees had higher recovery and resilience rates in the drought events analyzed. The highest tree mortality due to S. noctilio occurred in 2008, after successive drought events. These results are discussed in relation to silviculture and pest management inplantations.@@@Growth response

Our study compared the financial viability and growth of valuable timber species in monocultures and mixtures on infertile soils. Our work shows the extraordinary growth in volume and value of Dalbergia retusa and Terminalia amazonia while underscoring the poor financial viability of Tectona grandis and Pachira quinata, all commonly planted timber species in Panama and much of Central and South America. Using Bayesian statistics, our predictions show that T. amazonia monocultures could reach nearly 200 m3 ha−1 of merchantable volume after 30 years compared to the ~ 40 m3 ha−1 that T. grandis could accumulate in the same time frame. While D. retusa monocultures did not have the highest predicted merchantable volumes of all the species, it did have the highest predicted net present value (NPV), with a predicted mean NPV of > US$97,000 ha−1, quadrupling the species with the next highest monoculture’s NPV, T. amazonia monocultures (~ US$20,000 ha−1). Our work emphasizes that reforestation can be financially viable on low nutrient soils, even in the absence of fertilization or other silvicultural manipulations, if species selection and site are carefully considered and matched.@@@Agua Salud Project

In an attempt to determine if parental seed source ecotype and seedling greenhouse preconditioning could influence survival and growth of two common restoration tree species, seeds from American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) and willow oak (Quercus phellos L.) were collected from upland and floodplain sites in the Piedmont and Ridge and Valley regions of Virginia and were subjected to greenhouse flooding and drought preconditioning prior to field planting. American sycamore seedlings grown under normal conditions were 15 % shorter than seedlings subjected to flood preconditioning but had 13 % greater height than drought preconditioned seedlings. Preconditioning did not have a significant effect on willow oak seedling height. American sycamore seedlings sourced from dry ecotypes were 14 % taller than seedlings sourced from wet ecotypes, while willow oak seedlings sourced from wet ecotypes were 11 % taller than dry ecotype acorns. Seedlings from dry ecotype parents for American sycamore and seedlings from wet ecotype parents for willow oak may increase survival and growth of these species on marginal Piedmont agricultural sites. Adaptations observed after greenhouse preconditioning did not increase survivability or growth. Selection of seed sources from trees that exhibit good growth and vigor in landscape settings similar to the restoration area may increase the likelihood of meeting restoration goals and objectives.@@@Silviculture

In this study, we used miniature plots to estimate and explain site productivity for three widely planted hardwood tree species: Acacia mangium, Falcataria moluccana and Eucalyptus pellita. Miniature plots investigate forest productivity by carrying out very small-scale, short-term experimental studies and treating the results as analogous to what would occur in an operational-scale forest stand over a normal rotation. Miniature plots were established in three separate compartments of a tropical forest plantation in southeastern Sabah, Malaysia. Plots included the three species of interest, each with a fertilised and unfertilised subplot. Assessments were made of site and soil factors including soil profile properties and laboratory analysis of soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus (total and available) and pH. Tree growth was measured for nine months to estimate site productivity. Results suggest the need for research focusing on the role of soil carbon, carbon:nitrogen ratio, available phosphate and possibly soil pH in tropical plantation productivity, as well as the potential for large increases in productivity with high rates of fertiliser. In addition, there were differences in the fertiliser response between species, suggesting that F. moluccana in particular might respond more strongly than A. mangium to high application rates of fertiliser. The results also suggest that miniature plots have considerable potential for monitoring and investigating site productivity in fast-growth tree plantations in Southeast Asia.@@@Forest productivity

In this study, we evaluated the effects of nutrient solutions deplete in B, Cu, or Zn on the nutrition, growth, and production of biochemical compounds in Eucalyptus urophylla cuttings. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse for 90 days, with clonal cuttings of E. urophylla at four months of age. The treatments evaluated were complete fertilization (CF) and individual omissions of B, Cu, and Zn in the nutrient solution. The omission of Cu and Zn increased the concentration of carbohydrates in the leaves by 10% and reduced the rate of CO2 assimilation (A) by more than 30%. Cu omission decreased the lignification process compared to complete fertilization. Flavonoid production in plants with complete fertilization was 45–75% higher than that in plants maintained under B, Cu, or Zn deficiencies. Collectively, these results suggest that micronutrient deficiencies may reduce plant productivity as well as plant resistance to pests and pathogens.@@@Biochemical compounds

Shrubs play an important role in the boreal forest. However, it is not clear how shrub growth responds to climate change, especially whether there is a difference in the response of shrub at different altitudes to climate change. Here, we developed three ring-width chronologies of Pinus pumila along an altitudinal gradient in the Aokelidui Mountains, northeast China, then analyzed the relationship between the growth of P. pumila and climate at different altitudes. The results showed that the radial growth of P. pumila at low altitude had more prominent climate signals than those at medium and high altitude and was more sensitive to climate change. The chronological similarity was the highest in low and middle altitudes (72.5%, p < 0.01). Summer temperature had a significant negative effect on the growth of shrubs, and summer precipitation was conducive to the formation of wider rings at medium altitude. The warmer winter of the previous year favored P. pumila growth at low and medium altitudes but just the opposite at high altitudes. After rapid warming, the negative correlation between temperature and P. pumila growth in the growing season changed to a positive correlation at high altitude. On the contrary, the relationship between precipitation and P. pumila growth in the growing season changed from a positive to a negative correlation. We also found that the sensitivity of the growth of P. pumila to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) has gradually increased at medium-altitude since the 1980s. Therefore, in recent decades, the effect of moisture on the radial growth of shrub has become more and more important at medium altitudes. At the same time, the temperature rise was beneficial to the growth of P. pumila at low altitude. Our results suggest that the treeline advancement in this area is unlikely to occur in the near future since the shrub at high altitudes is not sensitive to climate warming.@@@Shrub

The application of moderate water stress to improve seedling drought resistance may be an option to harden summer-plant seedlings. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of watering intensity and duration of acclimation treatments on seedling morphology and physiology attributes in the nursery and on the field performance of Pinus tabuliformis. We applied three watering intensities at 45%, 60%, 75% (control) of container capacity (CC) in the nursery for three durations (2, 3 and 4 weeks) during early summer and then correspondingly outplanted in three dates across July (i.e., 11th, 18th, and 27th). We measured seedling morphology, non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in the nursery, and in the field. Additionally, we measured field mortality and plant growth for three years. Drought hardening led to greater bud set and TNC reserves, along with lower shoot-to-root mass ratio (S/R). Longer drought hardening duration produced seedlings with larger stem volume, lower S/R and lower N concentration, but with greater root mass and bud set. Field mortality primarily occurred in the winter, with the three-week drought hardening causing increased winter mortality but enhanced field growth. Mortality during the first winter was negatively related to shoot TNC reserves but positively related to seedling field growth measured at the beginning of the fall, cold season. Mortality during the second winter was negatively related to seedling size but positively related to S/R measured at the end of second growing season. In contrast, drought hardening intensity had no effect on outplanting mortality and only a minor effect on field growth. Field growth in subsequent growing seasons was directly related to the size of the plant, N and TNC content at the beginning of the first fall cold season. This study demonstrates that higher TNC reserves were associated with smaller stem volume during the first growing season, suggesting a trade-off between growth and TNC storage. This suggests that under non-stressed conditions the TNC concentration and growth of seedlings before winter strongly affected their mortality during winter. Study results suggest that summer planting of P. tabuliformis container seedlings is feasible without the application of drought hardening acclimation treatments in geographic locations typically having summer rains. Optimizing the outplanting date during the summer and initial seedling size appear to be critical for good mid-term growth and low winter mortality.@@@Nursery acclimation

We have investigated the physiological and biochemical impact of a high-salinity episode on young cork oak (Q. suber) plants. Besides the control (plants only irrigated with water), two experimental groups (irrigated once with a 300 mM NaCl solution) were analysed, one assessed at 24 h and the other at 6 days. Pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) were found increased at 24 h, but decreased at day 6 in salinity conditions. Sugars (glucose, sucrose, starch but not fructose) increased with stress (24 h and 6 days). Salinity conditions impaired photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, mostly associated with decrease in Fv′/Fm′ and chlorophyll content (6 days). While hydrogen peroxide levels did not increase above control levels, lipid peroxidation increased, suggesting oxidative damage. In salinity conditions, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase showed higher activity in the 24 h timepoint, whereas catalase activity increased at 24 h and 6 days. These observations reveal adaptations of Q. suber to high salinity, nevertheless, the decreased photosynthetic activity and oxidative damages observed suggest that additional studies are required to assess Q. suber adaptation to diverse salinity conditions. Moreover, these data provide more information for future programs of conservation and management of salinity areas in the Mediterranean region, and selection of salinity tolerant species.@@@Carbohydrates

Compared to other countries, little is known about C sequestration after grassland conversion to plantation forestry in South Africa. To this aim 27 sites were studied in the Weatherley catchment in the north eastern part of the Eastern Cape Province. About half of this 160 ha grassed catchment was planted to Pinus elliottii, Pinus patula, and Eucalyptus nitens. Soil organic carbon was measured in detail at the 27 sites before and eight years after afforestation, and augmented with litter and above-ground biomass measurements. The total C stocks for the different tree species and grassland areas were lowest for the grassland area (43.6 Mg C ha−1) and highest for the Pinus patula and Eucalyptus nitens areas (90.0 and 91.6 Mg C ha−1 respectively). In general, the afforested catchment aboveground C stocks contributed about a third to the total C stocks. Afforested soils in the poorly drained class had the lowest total C stocks (69.6 Mg C ha−1) compared to the freely drained soil group, which had 87.7 Mg C ha−1. Poorly and freely drained soil conditions therefore seemed to restrain tree growth while C sequestration was promoted on moderately drained soils. Afforestation contributed a total gain of 2 187 Mg C to the catchment, at a rate of 273 Mg C a−1 or 3.59 Mg C ha−1 a−1 for the afforested area only. The C sequestration rate by the plantation forest system was therefore 2.6 times that of the grassland system.@@@Carbon sequestration

However, the effectiveness of N-fixers during tropical forest restoration remains unclear. We hypothesized that tree legumes adjust growth, nonstructural carbohydrate allocation and foliar nutrients under different fertilization regimes. We compared the following six tree legume species: three native nonfixers (Cenostigma, Senna and Dipteryx), two native N-fixers (Clitoria and Inga) and an introduced N-fixer (Acacia). Twenty-four months after the experiment was established, fertilized plants increased growth rates and starch allocation to leaves, whereas unfertilized plants primarily increased their biomass and starch allocation to roots. The greater tolerance to nutrient deficiency of the Acacia than other native tree legumes was due to Acacia’s ability to adjust carbohydrate pools. N-fixers adjusted the shoot-to-root ratio and soluble sugar allocation to leaves, increasing biomass growth. The three N-fixing species were especially suitable for restoration because Acacia had tolerance of nutrient deficiencies, Clitoria and Inga had fast growth and biomass production. Hence, fertilization management and N-fixing species may have a considerable impact on C stocks in different plant compartments. Overall non-structural carbohydrate adjustments influence growth responses of species, especially the ratio between leaf and root tissues. Our findings suggest that this aspect should be considered as a tree species selection criterion for forest restoration programs in the Amazon region.@@@Biomass allocation

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the biomass and nutrients for the hybrid Eucalyptus urograndis and Acacia mearnsii in monospecific and mixed-species stands at the age of 9 years. For this, the study was carried out in an experimental area in South of Brazil, with three treatments: 100% E. urograndis; 100% A. mearnsii; 50% E. urograndis + 50% A. mearnsii. The hybrid E. urograndis showed lower stemwood in mixed-species planting (105.8 Mg ha−1) when compared to monospecific planting (145.5 Mg ha−1), however A. mearnsii, which increased stemwood at planting (213.9 Mg ha−1) relating to its pure planting (143.6 Mg ha−1). The nitrogen concentration in the leaves and stembark (25 and 5 g kg−1, respectively) of A. mearnsii was significantly higher than that found in the respective hybrid E. urograndis components (18 and 3 g kg−1 for leaves and stembark, respectively). A. mearnsii had higher accumulation of biomass and nutrient accumulation in the mixed-species plantation when compared to its monoculture, and the inverse was observed for the hybrid E. urograndis, thus showing that mixed-species planting exerted a competition effect on eucalyptus.@@@Mixed-species

We aimed to (a) compare vegetation indices (VIs; that is: NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; GNDVI, Green NDVI and NIRv, near-infrared reflectance of vegetation) retrieved by NIR-camera and spectrometer in order to test the reliability of a simple, low-cost, and rapid setup for widespread field applications; (b) to assess if NIR-camera VIs might be used to quantify water stress in oak seedlings; and (c) to track changes in leaf chlorophyll content. The study was carried out during a water stress test on 1-year-old seedlings in a greenhouse. The camera detected plant status in response to drought with results highly comparable to the visible/NIR (VIS/NIR) spectrometer (by calibration and standard geometry). Consistency between VIs and morpho-physiological traits was higher in Q. robur, the most drought-sensitive among the three species. Chlorophyll content was estimated with a high goodness-of-fit by VIs or reflectance bands in the visible range. Overall, NDVI performed better than GNDVI and NIRv, and VIs performed better than single bands. Looking forward, NIR-camera VIs are adequate for the early monitoring of drought stress in oak seedlings (or small trees) in the post-planting phase or in nursery settings, thus offering a new, reliable alternative for when costs are crucial, such as in the context of restoration programs.@@@Forest seedlings

The continued survival of scattered ash trees known as “lingering ash” in heavily infested natural stands, however, offers evidence of genetic resistance or tolerance to EAB. These surviving or “lingering” ash individuals may form the basis for reforestation programs in EAB-impacted areas, and clonal mass-propagation of these genotypes can help accelerate these efforts. Between 2013 and 2018, we initiated embryogenic cultures by culturing immature zygotic embryos from open-pollinated (OP) seeds collected from several surviving white ash and green ash trees in Michigan and Pennsylvania. In addition, in 2018, we initiated cultures from crosses made between lingering green ash parents from the USDA Forest Service ash breeding program in Ohio. Somatic embryos were produced by growing cultures in liquid suspension, followed by fractionation and plating on semisolid medium to produce developmentally synchronous populations of somatic embryos. Somatic embryo germination and conversion were enhanced by a combination of pre-germination cold treatment and inclusion of activated charcoal and gibberellic acid in the germination medium. Ash somatic seedlings derived from OP explants grew rapidly following transfer to potting mix and somatic seedlings representing nine ash clones were acclimatized, grown in the greenhouse and planted in a preliminary field test, along with EAB-resistant Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica) and EAB-susceptible control seedlings. Somatic seedlings have now been produced from cultures that originated from seeds derived from the progeny of lingering green ash parents and an ex vitro germination protocol has shown some promise for accelerating early somatic seedling growth. Results of this research could provide the basis for scaled-up production of EAB-resistant ash varieties for seed orchard production for forest restoration and cultivar development for urban tree restoration.@@@Clonal propagation

However, whether intraspecific differences in seedling size can affect nutrient reserve buildup is unknown. This study examined the effects of seedling size and fall fertilization on the uptake and resorption of nitrogen (N), as well as the allocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and N in cultivated Quercus variabilis Blume. After the formation of terminal buds (T1), seedlings were stratified into small (shoot height < 30 cm) and large seedlings. During the hardening period, seedlings were treated with three different rates of 15 N-enriched fertilizer (0, 12, or 24 mg N seedling−1) and monitored until leaf fall (T2). Small seedlings had lower N resorption efficiency and resorbed proportionally less N than large seedlings. Fall fertilization notably improved N and NSC reserves, without reducing N resorption efficiency. Large seedlings allocated proportionally less N to leaves than small seedlings although both sizes seedlings absorbed similar amounts of N from fall fertilization. The priority perennial organ for NSC allocation was roots, while N allocation was dependent on the phenological growth stage of the seedling. Roots were prioritized during the rapid growth phase, while stems were prioritized during the hardening period. Under same fertilizer regime during the growth phase, large seedlings tends to have lower N concentration and have higher resorption efficiency compare to small seedlings, fall fertilization can increase N storage in large seedlings and NSC levels in both seedling sizes, without affecting growth.@@@Oak

However, in West Africa, knowledge of how much carbon is stored in deeper soil layers of various forest cover types and protected from further release into the atmosphere remains scanty. We quantified the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents of tropical soils in Ghana at 0–20 cm and 20–50 cm, by comparing a degraded forest and an intact forest in the semi-deciduous forest zone, and intact forest, degraded forest, and agroforestry plantations in the moist evergreen forest zone. In semi-deciduous forests, C concentration was significantly higher for intact forest than degraded forest, but total C content of soils from the intact forest was not greater than the degraded forest due to compensating differences in bulk density. C content differed by depth for the two forests, with values at 0–20 cm of 48.1 vs 38.4 Mg ha−1 and at 20–50 cm of 20.6 vs 26.5 Mg ha−1, for degraded and intact forests respectively. In moist evergreen forests, soil C concentrations were similar between intact forest, degraded forest and plantations, yet, differed between the depths. Among the three, soils under plantations had the highest C content due to higher bulk density. For N, differences among cover types and soil depths followed similar patterns as those for C. Our results suggest the potential for formerly disturbed or degraded forests to gain more C lies primarily in live forest biomass, not in soil, especially if forests have maintained vegetative cover of some type since disturbance. The potentially large capacity for deeper soil layers to store C, and their reduced susceptibility to forest disturbance makes them an important soil carbon pool to further quantify and preserve.@@@C content

Both species grow in either pure or mixed stands. In the last decades, several A. chilensis stands have been degraded by different disturbances that have compromised their natural regeneration. Plantation of seedlings of both species may be an alternative to help restore ecological, scenic and productive characteristics of these stands. In this study, we determined, in degraded A. chilensis stands grown in a xeric (≈ 690 mm.yr−1) and a mesic (≈ 984 mm.yr−1) site without canopy cover, the effects of tree shelters, the presence/absence of neighboring herbaceous vegetation, and the interaction between these factors on the performance (i.e. survival and growth) of planted N. dombeyi and A. chilensis seedlings, during four growing seasons. Results showed that tree shelters improved survival of N. dombeyi in the mesic site, and improved survival of both species in the xeric site. The removal of neighboring herbaceous vegetation improved the survival and diameter growth of both species at the xeric site, and improved the diameter growth of both species at the mesic site. By applying these planting technologies, both species could be successfully used for restoring highly degraded A. chilensis stands at mesic sites, while it is more advisable to use A. chilensis at xeric sites under open sky conditions.@@@Austrocedrus chilensis

The stress-gradient hypothesis predicts that facilitation increases under harsh environments, but disturbance type and nurse shrub characteristics may modify this prediction. We aim at assessing the effect of two interacting factors (herbivory pressure and light availability) and palatability of the nurse shrub on the importance of nurse effect for active restoration of mixed evergreen forests of northern Patagonia (Argentina) for silvopastoral use. We planted Austrocedrus chilensis seedlings under two silvopastoral use intensities (higher and lower according to livestock seasonal movements) and under three micro-site treatments (palatable shrub, non-palatable shrub, inter-canopy), and evaluated survival and growth during three consecutive years. Under higher use intensity (increasing stress of light availability as desiccation risk and herbivory) we found contrasting effects of the nurse effect on seedling survival and growth, but the palatability of nurse shrub had no effect. Under higher use intensity, seedling survival was lower, while growth was higher. Higher values of seedling survival were found under low use intensity inter-canopy micro-site. Under high use, the presence of a nurse shrub is important for summer seedling survival, indicating its role in avoiding desiccation. The same occurred for winter seedling survival, where a nurse shrub may decrease mainly trampling risk. We highlight the importance of considering the interaction between disturbance factors for the net outcome of the nurse effect in active restoration actions, as it may allow for diverse actions to restoration.@@@Facilitation

In this study, we compared the growth of the mutant and normal clones from the same trees growing on different rootstocks and on different branches of the same rootstock to determine how a mutational WB affects a normal tree crown if they have the same starting position. We measured graft length, crown width, and stem diameter at the base of the graft in five pairs of 20-old mutant and normal clones originating from the same trees grafted on normal rootstock. The intrinsic capabilities of a witches’ broom are very limited. Single WB clones had 2.0–3.8-fold shorter stems, 1.5–2.0-fold lower crown width, and 1.2–2.0-fold lower stem diameter than single normal clones. When the mutant and normal clones grew together on a double-stem rootstock, mutant clones had approximately the same growth rate but easily suppressed normal crown clones. In this case, WB clones had 1.4–1.8-fold taller stem height, 3.0–4.0-fold higher crown width, and 2.5–4.0-fold higher stem diameter than normal crown clones due to the abnormally high attracting capacity of a WB. The more pronounced the specific traits in WB clones, such as reduced growth and increased branching, the more aggressive they behave relative to the normal crown to more quickly and strongly suppress growth. Characteristics of the WB, such as growth abnormality, aggressiveness relative to the normal crown, and reduced level of differentiation, make it more similar to a benign neoplasm.@@@Conifers

Resistance to blight has been achieved by the genetic insertion of a single copy of an oxalate oxidase gene into the chestnut genome. Here, we assess potential transgene impacts on American chestnut physiology, with a focus on photosynthesis and respiration. We collected measurements of leaf respiration and photosynthetic capacity for transgenic (T) and non-transgenic (NT) sibling trees in two distinct experiments. Multiple measurements of photosynthesis (light and CO2 response curves) and foliar traits (leaf mass per unit area, foliar N concentration) were indicative of equally high rates of photosynthetic capacity across T and NT plants, with no significant differences between groups. Photosynthetic rates were equivalent between T and NT plants across two studies in two locations. We observed a modest stimulation of foliar dark respiration in T vs. NT plants (~ 5–15%) across a range of temperatures, but no change in foliar respiration in the light. The modest stimulation of dark respiration did not seem to be associated with an alteration in growth rate, as stem diameter and length were equivalent between T and NT types. Our findings suggest that there may be a minor impact of transgene expression on the respiratory physiology in some situations, but this effect is not likely to strongly impact the physiological ecology of this historically important species.@@@Castanea dentata (American chestnut)

Our objective was to investigate whether E. japonica has invasive potential by examining morphological and physiological functional traits in response to drought events. We did field surveys in a cloud forest reserve, and determined responses to experimental drought on germination, growth, morphological (leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, and chlorophyll content) and physiological (hydraulic conductivity, maximum photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance) functional traits. Eriobotrya japonica adults, saplings, and seedlings were dominant in secondary forest, but scarce in mature forest. In lab, cumulative germination curves were similar across treatments (low–high temperatures; drought, water) while in the forest there was a delayed germination in drought treatment, though ultimately total germination was similarly high in the lab and field. Growth of seedlings was higher in light gaps than in the understory. However, leaf area was similar across treatments, SLA was lower, and thickness and chlorophyll content were higher in the gap-drought treatment. Physiological traits reinforced that E. japonica is highly drought resistant as demonstrated by avoidance of losses in hydraulic conductivity and high levels of carbon fixation. In a drought experiment, it took over 2 months to reach injurious losses in hydraulic conductivity. This study demonstrated that germination, growth, and physiological maintenance will all be unaffected in drought conditions and we concluded that E. japonica has potential to become an invasive alien species.@@@Drought tolerance

Although, the role of shelter tubes in alleviating the effects of drought and high-irradiance stresses during seedling establishment has been less studied than its effect on survival. The present study compares the effects of shelter tubes with different light transmissivities (Lt) on survival and morpho-physiological responses of two coexisting tree species (drought-tolerant Quillaja saponaria and relatively more drought-sensitive Maytenus boaria) of the Chilean matorral during an exceptionally dry and warm growing season (2014–2015). Two-year-old seedlings were randomly assigned to shelter tubes differing in Lt (20, 40, 60, 80%) or to a control (no shelter, Lt 100%) at field conditions. Survival was measured monthly, while shoot and root biomass, root length, pre-dawn xylem water potential, and non-structural carbohydrate concentration (NSC) were measured 8 months after transplanting. Shelter tubes increased the seedling survival of Q. saponaria by 80–100% relative to the control conditions, where full mortality was observed by the end of the experiment. By contrast, M. boaria exhibited high mortality regardless of the presence of shelters, suggesting that tubes were ineffective to alleviate the summer-related stresses in this species. Xylem water potential of Q. saponaria seedlings was significantly lower at 80% Lt than at 40% Lt, where maximum values were observed. Also, at 40% Lt, plant height and root length were highest and shoot/root ratio the lowest. By contrast, no differences in NSC, stomatal conductance, and photochemical efficiency were observed among Lt treatments. We conclude that shelter tubes may alleviate summer stresses in drought-tolerant species such as Q. saponaria; hence, they appear to be effective reforestation ecotechnology under severe water limitations and high-irradiance stress imposed by the current drought and heatwaves conditions in central Chile.@@@Shelter tube

The Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.), an emblematic alpine tree with important economic potential, conservation value and ecological relevance, was one of the species used in these afforestation efforts. We investigated the distribution and site characteristics of all known natural populations and planted stands in the canton of Fribourg (Switzerland). Between 1885 and 1952, artificial afforestation was carried out in the mountainous regions of the canton of Fribourg. Nearly 450,000 seedlings of P. cembra were planted. One century later, only approximately 650 trees survived (0.15% of all planted trees). Moreover, no natural regeneration can be observed in the afforested stands. Since no known harvest activities were undertaken in these planted stands, the whole afforestation campaign of P. cembra in the canton of Fribourg can be described as a failure. Possible causes are investigated and discussed. In this region, P. cembra occurs naturally only in particular microrefugia with markedly rough topography. We argue that the lack of knowledge or consideration of the ecology of the species at a local scale can be an important factor leading to this failure. In the actual context of large-scale afforestation projects anticipating and mitigating the negative effects of global warming, our study highlights the importance of a precise understanding of species ecology and regional conditions.@@@Forestry history

Carbon sequestration is closely related to canopy photosynthesis, which greatly depends on the leaf-level photosynthesis. Quantifying the magnitude of canopy photosynthesis will improve the modeling of forest carbon cycling. Although biochemical models have been widely used to estimate primary production, the effects of canopy partition on the photosynthetic rates and its feed-backs into the carbon cycle are generally not represented. In this study, the difference and connection between the leaf gas exchange indices in the different canopy partitions and the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown diameter (CD), and living under branch height (BH) were determined, and a multiple linear regression model was explored. This study was performed to develop a regression model to link morphological and physiological characteristics to canopy photosynthetic rate. The classification methods improved the working efficiency, fitting performance, and prediction accuracy compared with the classical method. The classified DBH method exhibited the best fitting performance, because it had the highest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9060). The photosynthetic model of the spruce canopy with the aforementioned factors produced a good simulation (R2 = 0.9773) and provided data support to further estimate the carbon budget and primary net productivity of the spruce canopy. The developed model was also very useful for updating and modifying forest base maps and registries of spatial distribution of biomass and carbon storage.@@@Canopy photosynthesis

However, these expectations are not always fulfilled, because natural hybridization between divergent populations can lead to inadequate or unviable hybrids and, therefore, lower forest stability and productivity. Using pure species Pinus arizonica, P. cembroides, P. durangensis, P. engelmannii, P. leiophylla, P. lumholtzii and P. teocote trees and their natural hybrids, this study aims to determine for the first time: (i) morphological differences between pure pine trees and their hybrids molecularly detected, (ii) differences in vigor between 1970 seeds from trees of pure pine species and their hybrid trees (hereinafter called pure and hybrid parents), (iii) differences in vigor between 3465 seedlings from 1421 pure and hybrid parents, and (iv) whether growth of seedlings of hybrid parents is differently associated to parent tree’s environmental conditions, than growth of seedlings of pure parents. The seedlings grew under equal nursery conditions. Our results show some significant differences in morphological traits between the seed trees of pure species and their respective putative hybrid seed trees, and in seed and seedling fitness indices. In contrast to the mean growth of seedlings of hybrid parents, the mean growth of seedlings from pure parents was significantly associated with the parent tree’s bioclimatic conditions studied (R2 = 0.70 vs 0.83).

The main factors that hinder the natural recovery of these forests and the feasibility of native tree plantations are the exotic herbivorous pressure, like that produced by Lepus europaeus (European hare), and the environment degradation degree by anthropic disturbances. The objective of this study was to evaluate different plantation efforts to recover N. pumilio forests degraded by fires in Chilean Patagonia. The plantation actions also included wire fences for sapling protection in 100 ha, where 60 ha were established during autumn (May 2012), and 40 ha were established during spring (October 2012). In March 2013 we recorded the height annual growth (cm year−1), the section browsed at each sapling, the modification of plant form (number of new branches), and the vigor expression. We evaluated the data using one- and two-way ANOVAs, Cohen’s d effect size, and chi-square analyses. We measured a total of 872 plants, where 42% presented damages caused by European hare browsing. These results indicated that the wire fences were not completely useful to stop the damage on saplings (Cohen’s d effect size =  < 0.2). We also found that autumn plantations were more susceptible to damage than those established during spring. European hares predominantly browsed on a particular sapling section: the apical buds. As a consequence, the browsed saplings had lower height growth than undamaged ones. These outputs highlight the need to explore and implement alternative actions for the rehabilitation of these degraded deciduous forests, to achieve the objectives of sustainable management or to recover the natural ecosystem functions.@@@Native tree plantations

The study aimed to evaluate whether morphological and physiological characteristics of seedlings from Eucalyptus species affect the N and P use efficiency. For this, in a greenhouse, Eucalyptus grandis (GPC 23) and Eucalyptus saligna (32864) clones were grown in Hoagland nutrient solution for 21 days, followed by N and P restriction in CaSO4 solution 0.1 mol L−1 during 15 days. Morphological parameters from shoot and root system, dry mass of organs, photosynthetic pigments concentration, and chlorophyll a fluorescence of Eucalyptus species were evaluated, and NUE and PUE were calculated. Eucalyptus grandis presented the highest NUE and PUE values. The highest surface area, volume, and roots length values contributed to these results, justifying the highest dry mass production from leaves, stem, roots, and plant. Eucalyptus saligna presented the lowest NUE and PUE values, which negatively influenced photosynthesis (higher F0 values and lower concentrations of photosynthetic pigments). Root morphological parameters had a strong relationship with NUE and PUE and can be used to select Eucalyptus species, and breeding programs, as they can predict the ability of development of Eucalyptus species under low N and P availability.@@@Eucalypt selection

Management options can be supported by models of biomass and coppice recovery, and this paper presents the first empirical coppice growth model for mallee eucalypts. Uncoppiced and coppiced belt-planted Eucalyptus polybractea, E. loxophleba and E. kochii were harvested and roots excavated to provide estimates of shoot and root biomass for analysis and model development. Allometric models of shoot biomass were appropriate for both uncoppiced and coppiced trees, but models of root/total biomass ratio for coppice depended on site quality and age, and could not be modelled allometrically. Mean root/total biomass proportions for uncoppiced trees were estimated (with standard errors) to be 0.38 (0.009), 0.50 (0.031), and 0.46 (0.021) for E. polybractea, E. loxophleba, and E. kochii respectively and were sensitive to site quality but insensitive to age. The time taken to regain pre-coppice shoot biomass was about half that of full pre-cut root/total biomass ratio recovery, and was affected by coppicing age and site quality. A conceptual model of coppice growth indicated that coppiced stands may produce more total biomass than uncoppiced stands of the same age.@@@Carbon sequestration

Crown leaf-out and leaf-fall phenology was evaluated on 168 open-pollinated families from 19 Cedrela odorata provenances in an eleven-year-old provenance/progeny trial established in the state of Veracruz, Eastern coast of Mexico. The objectives were: (a) to evaluate the extent of inter- and intra-population genetic variation of leaf phenology traits; (b) to examine the relationship between leaf phenology traits and climate variables at the population level; (c) to estimate the genetic relationships between leaf phenology and growth traits; and (d) to evaluate the accuracy, in terms of genetic control, of using alternative methods to measure leaf phenology in broadleaf trees. The study revealed significant genetic variation in leaf phenology traits both among and within populations. Leaf-out traits showed higher genetic variation than leaf-fall traits. A moderate to large genetic differentiation among Cedrela odorata populations was found; Qst values for leaf-out were 2–6 times higher than those for leaf-fall. Leaf-fall was primarily associated with mean annual temperature, while leaf-out and length of the leafless period were related to annual precipitation and the aridity index of the site of origin. Leaf phenology traits showed moderate to high genetic control (h2i = 0.12–0.67; h2f = 0.27–0.72). However, it was higher for leaf-out traits, so they might play a more important adaptive role.

In order to better understand the physiological and technical aspects of yerba mate vegetative propagation, the present study sought to evaluate the rhizogenic capacity of apical and basal mini-cuttings from different genotypes (named A3, A7, F1 and F2) and the possible relationships between rooting and specific biochemical and anatomical aspects of the species. After 90 days under greenhouse conditions, the following variables were assessed: mini-cuttings rooting percentage, number of roots, roots length, callogenesis, mortality, sprouting and leaf retention. Mini-cuttings samples were collected at the time of planting and after 90 days in the rooting environment in order to investigate the aspects related to stem and roots anatomy as well as the levels of phenolic compounds (PC) and the activities of peroxidade (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes. Genotype A3 presented the best rooting performance (65.6% rooting) while F2 had the lower rooting rates (24.5%). Apical and basal mini-cuttings did not differ regarding rooting associated variables. Both mini-cuttings types and the four genotypes showed identical anatomical features, with no evident mechanical barriers to roots emission. Despite specific differences on POD, PPO and PC activities/contents as influenced by topophysis, genotype and/or their interaction, no direct relationship could be stated between the biochemical features at the time of planting or 90 days after and the overall rooting performance of yerba mate the mini-cuttings. The present study not only provides valuable information on technical aspects of yerba mate propagation but also presents insights in the physiological and anatomical traits of adventitious rhizogenesis in this species.

The coated seeds were used for regeneration on 12 clearcut sites, covering a 1000 km latitudinal gradient across Sweden. The coating was either combined with arginine-phosphate fertilizer (10 mg N per seed) or had no additions. Interactions with environmental variables associated with sites were also assessed. Coated seeds were deployed in May–June 2017 and surveyed in August–September of 2018 and 2019. After two years, the mean establishment rate of seedlings from coated seeds was 56 ± 4% across the 12 sites. The fertilizer addition did not affect survival, and the biomass response to fertilizer varied significantly between sites. Maximum precipitation and wind speed during the first six weeks after deployment were correlated with seedling survival, regardless of fertilization treatment. Establishment increased with increasing precipitation and decreased with increasing wind speed. This highlights the importance of initial weather conditions for the seeds’ establishment. Our data suggest that Scots pine regeneration using coated seeds can be practiced in boreal forests, but also that the method is sensitive to the weather conditions at the time of deployment of the seeds.@@@Scots pine

Among the endangered species is the Açaí (Euterpe oleracea), which is a species with great national and international interest, due to the nutritional benefits and medicinal properties of its fruits. However, there is still no information on the ecophysiological responses of Açaí to climate change. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of increased temperature and CO2 concentration change on the ecophysiology of Açaí seedlings. To do so, Açaí seedlings were subjected, for 90 days, to three different climatic scenarios: current Amazon; RCP4.5 (current average temperature in the Amazon + 2.5 °C and 538 ppm of carbon dioxide concentration i.e. CO2); and RCP8.5 (+ 4.5 °C and 936 ppm of CO2 concentration). In addition, two irrigation levels were applied within each climatic scenario: seedlings maintained at 90% (not stressed) and 40% (stressed) of the water holding capacity of the substrate. Gas exchange, water status, fluorescence parameters, enzymatic antioxidants activity and dry matter production were evaluated. High CO2 concentration enhanced Açaí gas exchange (increasing CO2 assimilation), regardless of substrate water availability and temperature. However, high temperature and high vapor-pressure deficit reduced quantum yield and increased the minimum fluorescence and enzymatic antioxidants activity. With that, Açaí seedlings did not convert the additional assimilated carbon (due to higher CO2 concentration) into biomass, showing decreased total dry mass accumulation for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios. Our results indicated that the positive impacts of increased CO2 concentration to gas exchange may not offset the negative impacts of increased air temperature and VPD to Açaí growth.@@@Amazon

A two-year study was conducted in a representative dehesa in southern Spain. Firstly, the effect of cattle dung pads on acorn consumption by livestock and wild predators was monitored, along with dung beetle abundance and plot bioturbation. Secondly, the indirect effects of bioturbation on acorn burial, acorn predation by rodents and oak seedling establishment were assessed under the condition of livestock exclusion. The results consistently demonstrate a high positive indirect effect of the presence of cattle manure on the persistence of acorns, as well as on seedling establishment, as a result of reduced predation by rodents and improved microhabitat conditions for the acorns and seedlings. These processes were mediated by bioturbation. Tunneler dung beetles, which move a great amount of soil material, were dominant in our records, which suggest their importance for passive acorn burial, without disregarding the influence of other edaphic invertebrates present. We conclude that the presence of cattle manure significantly improves oak seedling establishment in Mediterranean dehesas through the passive burial of acorns by bioturbation, which acts to protect them from predation by rodents, desiccation and other damage. Passive acorn burial by dung beetles and other invertebrates thus emerges as an important ecosystem service that has been little-studied to date. Appropriate rotational management of livestock could therefore contribute to addressing the bottleneck of oak regeneration in Mediterranean dehesas.@@@Acorn predation

It is well known that growth rates can depend on functional traits and that the associations between functional traits and plant growth vary across ontogenetic stages. Here we studied if the response of growth rate to stand variables, that reflect ecological conditions, is associated with wood density, seed mass and height at maturity and if such relationships differ between saplings and seedlings. We measured the stem diameter increment over two years in 164 seedlings and 290 saplings of 30 tree species in 9 loblolly pine plantations in the Atlantic Forest, Argentina. The relationship between stem diameter increment and stand basal area, mean canopy openness and stand age was evaluated. The growth rate of saplings decreased with basal area and increased with canopy openness in species with wood density < 0.56 g.cm-3 or height at maturity > 23 m. No differences in growth rate response were found along seed mass. No consistent relationships between growth rate and stand variables were found in seedlings. We concluded that seedling growth rate is unrelated to stand variables while responsive species at sapling stage are those with low wood density or medium-high height at maturity. Silvicultural treatments reducing basal area can benefit the planted trees as well as unplanted saplings of medium-high valued native trees.@@@Wood density

This could be particularly valuable for alternative, non-mainstream Eucalyptus species that are still in the initial stages of breeding. Eucalyptus benthamii is important for its adaptation to frost-prone subtropical regions. In this work, we compared seven genomic prediction models, six Bayesian and one frequentist GBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) with the conventional pedigree-based ABLUP approach. Models were evaluated for their ability to estimate heritabilities and predict wood quality traits (wood density, extractives, lignin, and carbohydrates content) and volume growth in 77 open-pollinated families of Eucalyptus benthamii. We also evaluated predictive abilities and heritabilities using variable numbers of SNP in the models. Heritabilities ranged from 0.09 (extractives content) using Bayesian Lasso (BL) to 0.55 (wood density) using ABLUP. Predictive abilities (PA) ranged from 0.12 (for volume using ABLUP) to 0.44 (for wood density using three Bayesian models). All seven genomic models performed similarly well and better than the pedigree model for all traits, except extractives content. Subsets of 5000–7000 SNPs yielded heritabilities and PAs nearly as large as using all 15,293 SNPs. However, a low-density SNP panel might not be economically and technically advantageous compared to the current high-density multi-species Eucalyptus EUCHIP60k.

Little research, however, has examined the consequences of climate change on the distribution patterns of the rich endemic flora of this ecoregion. Climate change can be a major, and undesirable, threat to the various species of the Hyrcanian Forests ecoregion. Therefore, determining suitable habitats for the endemic species from this ecoregion is crucial for their conservation. Populus caspica Bornm, for example, is one of the endemic species of this area. We used the current locations of natural populations of P. caspica to predict the potential habitat range of this species by applying MAXENT algorithm for the present, past (Last Glacial Maximum—Holocene Optimum), and future (2070s) climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the range of the natural habitat of P. caspica expanded during the Holocene, and the present range is wider than that of the past (about 6 ka BP) ages. Climate changes, however, will negatively impact the future habitat range of this species, reducing suitable range by up to 63.46% in the Hyrcanian forests, and only 36.54% of the stable habitats will be retained. These findings can be used to develop an effective conservation strategy for the future. Our models suggest a common priority area in the Eastern part of the Hyrcanian Forests, where the populations of P. caspica are at high risk and should be taken under special protection.@@@Caspian poplar

In the United States, when these protective compounds are claimed to provide plant defense or plant growth regulation, they are pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and may be regulated as such by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These substances are classified as plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) and consist of the pesticidal substance(s) and the genetic material necessary for its production. EPA’s regulatory focus is the PIP, but not the plant. EPA has exempted from regulation PIPs that are moved among sexually compatible plants using conventional breeding. PIPs introduced into a living plant through genetic engineering and gene editing, however, currently remain subject to EPA regulation. This regulation requires a risk assessment process where product characterization, human health toxicity and allergenicity data, environmental impacts on non-target organisms, and environmental fate of the pesticidal substance are all considered. Environmental fate of the PIP includes instances wherein gene flow to sexually compatible species results in expression of the pesticidal substance in wild or non-managed populations. In addition, if residues of PIPs are present in food or feed, they are further evaluated by EPA under Sect. 408 of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Regulation of forest trees genetically engineered to express PIPs adds critical oversight the pubic insists upon; however, the long-lived nature of trees and the opportunity for gene flow to related species in a forest ecosystem will complicate the risk assessment process as compared to processes used for highly managed annual row crops, which currently compose the vast majority of commercial PIP products. Establishment and spread of PIP traits into forest ecosystems may require risk assessors to use mathematical models and expanded non-target organism considerations prior to approval for environmental release.@@@Plant-Incorporated Protectants

We analyzed the influence of heat shock and the presence of ash as substrate on seed germination and early vigor of seedlings of distinct cohorts of P. radiata that developed under the influence of fire or in the absence of it, i.e. post-fire invasion and unburned plantation, respectively. Seeds were collected from the Reserva Forestal Lago Epuyén in Northern Patagonia, Argentina. The natural history of this region is characterized by the occurrence of extensive fires. Ten randomly selected trees from unburned plantations and post-fire invasion that occurred in 1987 of similar age were cut down and 10 serotinous cones by plant were collected without color or size bias. Seeds from both stand types were subjected to four treatments: ash solution (5 g/L) and two thermal shocks (90 and 120 °C for 5 min), and a control without thermal shock or ash presence. The number of germinated seeds was counted every 5 days during 30 days. Germination percentages observed were high (between 80 and 100%) for both seed sources and under all the fire-associated treatments. Post-fire invasion had longer radicles with ash and under the thermal shock at 90 °C, as well as a higher percentage of seedlings that developed cotyledons and with the highest survival. Recurrent fires exert a significant effect on germination and early growth of the exotic P. radiata which may foster invasion.@@@Fire

In recent years, regeneration sampling has become relevant as extensive forest regeneration areas are developing in the wake of the devastations caused by bark beetle attacks in the Northern Hemisphere. Estimating a population of interest is especially challenging in plant communities where the measurement of individual plants is technically complicated, as in the case of seedlings and saplings in multi-species communities. Two methods of regeneration sampling are presented in this study. One involves a 10 m2 circular plot, the other is based on the distance between neighbouring seedlings. Completely enumerated, mapped and sufficiently large populations of seedlings are rarely, if ever, available. It was necessary therefore, to simulate a range of populations with different combinations of seedling density, species richness and height distribution, for different spatial patterns. The accuracy of each sampling method is evaluated for increasing sampling intensity in terms of species richness, seedling density and seedling height distribution. Our results show that Staupendahl's circular plot method provides unbiased density estimation and is therefore preferred. Seven samples per ha provide estimates of seedling density, mean height and species richness with a relative deviation of less than 20 percent. One seedling may be sufficient in boreal forests while two or more seedlings should be assessed at each sample point when the number of seedling species is high. Our results indicate significant differences between the methods in assessing species richness, and the regeneration neighborhood unit method is recommended. The study presents a systematic approach for evaluating different sampling methods when field data are not available.@@@Regeneration

Among other things it allows for an undisturbed root development and is assumed to be cost-efficient. While success factors have been worked out through numerous experiments, sound overviews of success and failure in practice are scarce. With the goals of (i) quantifying the success proportion and (ii) extracting the associated influencing factors, we conducted an inventory of direct seedings of Douglas fir in Northern Germany and fitted a hurdle negative binomial regression model to the data. The results reveal a high variability of plant density within, as well as between stands. We could attribute these differences, and thus the success, to stocking degree of the shelter, seed amount and age. The model shows both, a high precision and accuracy, and respects previous physical and biological knowledge of the data-generating mechanisms.@@@Direct seeding

The use of drought-resistant clones allows mitigating the negative effects of water deficit on the establishment and the productivity of unstable irrigated plantations in dryland areas. We evaluated the responses of four Populus × canadensis (‘Conti 12’, ‘Guardi’, ‘I-214’ and ‘I45/51’) and four Populus deltoides (‘Stoneville 67’, ‘Catfish 2’, ‘Dvina’ and ‘Australiano 129/60’) clones to a short-term water stress. Three water treatments were imposed on 6-month-old plants: well-watered (WW), 5 days of irrigation withdrawal followed by rewatering (−5 + RW), and 9 days of irrigation withdrawal followed by rewatering (−9 + RW). Populus clones presented different strategies to face water deficit, resulting in variable effects on plant growth. The small-leaved clone ‘Australiano 129/60’ showed strong stomatal control and maintained a high increase in leaf area during the water-shortage period. These strategies were associated with high relative growth under both water-shortage treatments. ‘Australiano 129/60’ showed to be a drought-resistant clone with the highest growth under both water-shortage treatments, appearing to be a promising clone for production in environments prone to short-term water stress.@@@Poplar clones

Arboretums and common gardens comparing geographic origins within species can provide a large body of valuable information and material usable to increase forest resilience. Common gardens have been foundational in demonstrating the existence of genetic diversity, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. They have also been instrumental for forest management and policy, e.g., for guiding seed transfer rules and their marketing. While the current generation of common gardens has seen a renewed interest for developing process-based niche models or genome-trait-environment association studies, they are too limited in the number of species, provenances and habitats they sample in the context of climate change and novel bioeconomy focus.

To investigate how different species are expected to react to climate change, especially summer drought, we studied the xylem plasticity of six non-native conifer species from a Danish common garden based on the hypothesis that wood anatomy variables may be particularly valuable for predicting drought resistance differences between species. We focused on two xylem functional traits (tracheid wall thickness and lumen area) and three wood properties relevant for utilisation of the material (density, microfibril angle and stiffness) and studied how they were affected by drought and temperature in the period 1975–2012. The results showed that xylem traits responded stronger to summer drought (July and August) than to temperature, especially for the part of the ring produced late in the season. The response was stronger for Larix kaempferi (Lamb.) Carr., Picea abies (L.) Karst., Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. and Abies alba Mill., which formed latewood tracheids with smaller lumen and thicker walls, and wood characterised by higher density, lower microfibril angle and higher stiffness during drought years, than for Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco. The latter, and to some extent Abies grandis Lindl., showed lower response of xylem traits to summer drought. P. menziesii also showed only minor effects on growth ring widths and was the conifer species showing least effects from summer drought. Retrospective comparison of xylem plasticity between different species from common gardens was thus found to provide useful hints to species selection for afforestation in light of future climate scenarios.@@@Gymnosperm trees

As a result, large-scale tree planting projects have been initiated around the world. However, a number of these initiatives have unintentionally opened up risks to native forests and biodiversity while increasing exotic tree cover. Using the Aotearoa New Zealand One Billion Trees programme as a case study we reflect on what trees are being incentivised by these projects and the downstream impacts of how these projects are realised. We suggest ten recommendations for how these initiatives could be adapted to avoid perverse outcomes for native species while jointly achieving our carbon and biodiversity goals: (1) Diversify strategies—protect first, restore second, plant third; (2) Consider net change in trees—do not just count trees planted; (3) Consider the co-benefits of carbon and biodiversity from the outset; (4) Consider the broader landscape; (5) Consider the carbon and biodiversity benefits of soil; (6) Consider the importance of existing carbon stocks; (7) Consider potential impacts to non-tree ecosystems; (8) Consider the longevity of the future forest; (9) Support landowners in planting and maintaining native trees; (10) Remember that climate goals cannot be achieved by planting trees alone. We believe these recommendations are critical for improving the outcomes of the One Billion Trees programme in Aotearoa New Zealand, while providing important insights relevant to other tree planting initiatives around the world.@@@Tree-planting initiatives

A key conservation strategy consists of propagating HMF species in forest nurseries for subsequent repopulation in degraded areas. We evaluated genetic diversity in three natural populations (Huitepec, Bazom, and Mitzitón) and one nursery population of Styrax magnus Lundell (Styracaceae) in Chiapas, Mexico. We expected a lower genetic diversity in the nursery than in wild populations. Styrax magnus is restricted to the Mexican state of Chiapas, close to the border with Guatemala and is likely to be at risk of extinction due to habitat loss and its low establishment rate. We used ten enzyme loci to determine genetic diversity. Genetic structure was examined by calculating genetic differentiation (Fst) and Nei’s genetic distances (Nei, Am Nat 106:283–292, 1972), in addition a Bayesian analysis was performed. The populations examined showed a moderate (He = 0.31) average genetic diversity. Bazom was the most distant and genetically differentiated population and showed the lowest genetic diversity (He = 0.21). Mitzitón was the most diverse population (He = 0.40), whereas the nursery population showed an intermediate diversity (He = 0.30). We found a high level of total genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.48, P < 0.001), suggesting a limited gene flow between the populations studied. Our results suggest that propagation in the nursery promotes an intermediate level of genetic diversity (He) relative to wild populations, likely because the nursery population was made up by random seed collection from several sites. The genetic monitoring of introduced populations is highly recommended for an in-depth assessment of the success of actions aiming to conserve and restore HMF in Chiapas.@@@Chiapas

Conversely, fruit structures and seed coats may protect seeds from environmental harm in the field. We evaluated the effects of seed processing (by either keeping fruit structures or extracting seeds) and/or scarification (of physically dormant seeds) on the seedling emergence and establishment of 10 legume tree species from tropical forests and savannas of Central Brazil. We sowed seeds in a greenhouse for reference and in a field experiment conducted in tilled ready-to-seed sites. We monitored seedling emergence and survival for a year. We calculated the costs of harvesting, processing, and pretreating seeds, and considered the final cost of a 1-year-old seedling. Seed extraction resulted in lower emergence for most species in the greenhouse and in the field. It also accelerated emergence of three and four species in the greenhouse and the field, respectively. Scarification resulted in lower seedling emergence in the field for half of the species, while it increased emergence of three species in the greenhouse. Most species presented accelerated emergence both in the greenhouse and the field. The seedling cost was 1.6 to 74.6 times higher when seeds were processed, and 1.3 to 6.0 times when seeds were scarified, except for one species. Keeping fruit structures and seed coats reduced the costs of seeds and increased the success of direct seeding.@@@Cerrado

To inform the appropriate sample size, ninety-six cores and minirhizotrons in a subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest were used to examine diameter-related variation in the distribution of root length and volume, and assess the effects of sample size on estimation accuracy and sample representativeness. The variation coefficients of root traits estimated by the minirhizotron method were much higher than those estimated by the soil core method. Furthermore, minirhizotrons observed higher proportions of root length and volume in small diameter classes, reflecting thinner roots than those estimated by the soil core method. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that, for the 0–5 mm diameter class, under a confidence level of 90% and estimation accuracy of 80%, the sample size for soil cores required to estimate the root length and volume are 5 and 12, respectively, and for minirhizotrons being 54 and over 96, respectively. The cumulative root diameter class curve analysis shows that the sample sizes required to encounter 80%, 90% and 95% of all diameter classes for soil cores are 3, 6 and 10, respectively, and for minirhizotrons being 38, 61 and 77, respectively. We conclude that due to the fractal distribution of root diameter, and the difference in sampling volume between different methods, larger sample sizes are required for minirhizotrons or larger-diameter roots than for soil cores or smaller-diameter roots to achieve better estimation accuracy and sampling representativeness.@@@Distribution variation

Populus roots can develop dual mycorrhizal associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and with non-mycorrhizal fungal endophytes (FE). The symbiotic fungi may alleviate the effects of adverse environmental conditions. We investigated the performance (growth and symbiotic associations) of one-year-old Populus nigra ‘Italica’ grown from woody cuttings in soil from natural poplar habitat and subjected to water scarcity and soil salinity (50 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl). With increasing soil salinity, a decrease in the growth parameters of the aboveground parts of the poplar plantlets and their fine roots were found; however, the roots were more resistant to the stress factors analyzed than the shoots. ECMF, AMF, and non-mycorrhizal FE were all tolerant to increased salt levels in the soil, and the ECM abundance was significantly higher under conditions of mild salinity (50 mM NaCl, 150 mM NaCl) compared to the control plants and those treated with 250 mM NaCl. Our results indicated that enhanced soil salinity increased the content of sodium and chlorine in leaves, but did not affect significantly the concentrations potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, or nitrogen. Significant accumulation of proline in leaves suggest salt stress of P. nigra ‘Italica’ treated with 250 mM NaCl and contribution of proline to the plant defense reactions.@@@Lombardy poplar

The aims of this research were to evaluate the biomass production and C and nutrient pools in G. arborea established in a 15-year-old pure stand (PS) and a mixed stand (MS) in the State of Nayarit, Mexico. Three sampling plots of 1000 m2 were established in each type of stand. The diameter and height of the trees were measured and used to calculate biomass. Forest floor and mineral soil were also sampled. G. arborea represented 40% of the total tree volume in the MS but exhibited a larger diameter (12%) and basal area (11%) per tree in this stand. The productivity in the MS was 27% higher, having mineral soil with a better pH and C:N ratio than in the PS. The MS also contained 44.1% more biomass and 20.3% more C storage than the PS. The forest floor mass (1.3 Mg ha−1) and C (1 Mg ha−1) and N (0.3 Mg ha−1) pools in the MS were higher than in the PS. The mineral soil of both forest stands stored similar C pools. Overall (tree biomass + forest floor + mineral soil), the MS stored more N (13.0%), P (41.7%), K (25.1%), Fe (76.8%), Cu (41.5%) and Zn (38.7%).

Identifying ecophysiological responses to environmental stressors can provide important insights into mitigating measures that would allow seedlings to overcome such constraints to survival. Koa (Acacia koa A. Gray) is a nitrogen-fixing tree species endemic to Hawaiʻi that is highly valued in restoring degraded forest ecosystems, which are often limited in available water and phosphorus. This study examined how koa seedlings respond to conditions of reduced water (65 W) and no phosphorus (0P). After 17 weeks, seedlings subjected to 65 W or 0P accumulated less biomass, smaller root-collar diameters, and lower nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Combined reductions in water and P resulted in seedlings with increased root to shoot dry biomass and shorter shoots. Seedlings subjected to 65 W also had lower instantaneous rates of CO2 assimilation, but higher instantaneous water-use efficiencies following irrigation, suggesting that koa responds to water deficits by decreasing water loss via reduced stomatal conductance. Seedlings subjected to 0P had similar rates of CO2 assimilation relative to those grown with adequate P, suggesting that koa is able to employ strategies to avoid physiological impairment from conditions of inadequate P. Future research should assess whether subjecting koa seedlings to reduced water before planting on water-limited sites cues increased drought resistance and whether uptake and storage of P by seedlings in the nursery better supports growth following outplanting, particularly on sites with anticipated low plant-available water.@@@Drought

Suboptimal storage conditions can lead to reduced growth or even seedling mortality. Supporting favourable conditions for the seedlings during storage requires labour, especially for the watering of seedlings, and therefore increases the costs of forest regeneration. In this study, we examined the effects of covering Norway spruce container seedlings with a reflective shading cloth and neglecting the watering during field storage. This was done by measuring the drying of the seedlings during field storage, the rooting of the seedlings when planting, and the subsequent survival and performance in the field two and three growing seasons after planting. The study comprised one-year-old Norway spruce container seedlings covered with reflective shading cloth and seedlings with no cover (subject to rainfall) in 2012 and 2013; additionally, in 2013, replicates from both treatments were stored in conditions where rainfall was impeded. The stem water potential was measured, a rooting test was carried out, and the seedlings were planted in the test field weekly over 42 days of field storage without watering. As a novel finding, the results indicate that covering the seedlings with a reflective shading cloth during the field storage increased the risk of grey mould in summer storage and led to negative effects regarding post planting seedling development. The application of a shading cloth directly on the seedlings cannot be recommended to prolong the watering intervals during field storage in the current climatic conditions in Southern Finland, where the risk of grey mould is high.@@@Forest regeneration

Exploring the interaction effect of these factors on photosynthetic traits is helpful to understand the source-sink relationship between needles and cones. Here, we examined the impact of needle age on needle CO2 assimilation rate (Pn), needle mass per area (LMA), and needle concentration of soluble sugars, starch, total non-structural carbohydrates ([NSC]), nitrogen ([N]) and phosphorus ([P]) in cone‐bearing branches (reproductive branches) and branches without cones (vegetative branches) of Pinus koraiensis. We also compared instantaneous photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) and P-use efficiency (PPUE) in reproductive and vegetative branches. Our results showed that needles in reproductive branches had lower Pn, [N], [P], PNUE and PPUE than the needles in vegetative branches, but higher [NSC] and LMA. The differences between branch types were similar across needle ages, despite a clear effect of aging on photosynthetic traits: Pn, [N], [P], PNUE and PPUE decreased with increasing needle age, whereas LMA increased and [NSC] did not change with needle age. Unexpectedly, these results suggest that Pn in needles of reproductive branches is limited by NSC accumulation, and that N and P needed for cone development come from adjacent needles/reproductive branches while NSC come from more distant organs. These results shed light on the source-sink transport of carbon, N and P between needles and cones and are helpful for eventually predicting and improving crop size in Pinus koraiensis.@@@Korean pine

The graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) are dispersed in DI water with the addition of commonly used surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), polysorbate (Tween80), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and gum arabic (GA). The effect on the stability of different surfactants on the colloidal solution of GnP nanofluids is analyzed by zeta potential and particle size distribution. The average zeta potential values indicate that the SDBS-GnP, SDS-GnP, and GA-GnP combinations have good stability after 72 h. The freezing experiment is performed at − 7 °C cooling bath temperature in a spherical container and reveals that the surfactants have a significant influence on the supercooling rate and freezing time. The maximum reduction of 92.16% and 84.20% is observed for GA-GnP and SDBS-GnP in the supercooling rate, respectively. The prepared NFPCM can be incorporated in the CTS system owing to its enhanced thermal transport properties to increase the energy-saving potential. Also, the reduction of supercooling facilitates the chiller to operate at higher temperatures.@@@Freezing characteristics

Nonlinear models were tested to classify the productive capacity of B. excelsa stands of different ages (14 to 21 years), by algebraic difference method. We used a database of 75 temporary plots and complete stem analyses of 30 trees. Soil sampling was performed at depths of 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm, for chemical analyses (\({\text{pH}}_{{{\text{H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}}}\), pHKCl, C, P, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ and Na+) and physical (soil density, penetration resistance, granulometry). Topographic information was obtained by GPS and digital elevation image. Site classes were spatialized in the study area by method ordinary point kriging. Relationships between topoedaphic variables and site index were evaluated by correlation matrix to identify major characteristics limiting site productivity, and regression models were generated by stepwise backward method to evaluate whether topoedaphic characteristics explain growth variation in B. excelsa stands. The Chapman-Richards model presented good statistical performance, good distribution of residues, and resulted in consistent polymorphic curves. Polymorphism evaluation indicated differentiated growth patterns of specie among sites. Soil texture (sand content) and topography (elevation) were the main drivers of site productivity, followed by some soil chemical variables (K+, Mn2+ and pHKCl). These results can support planning of activities related to installation and management of B. excelsa stands in the Amazon, besides identifying potential areas of expansion of plantations of this species.@@@Brazil nut

K Koch seedlings through the application of spectroscopy techniques in different infrared ranges and chemometric methods@@@@@@Received: 01 October 2021 Accepted: 06 July 2022 Published: 23 July 2022@@@The origin of seed and seedlings is an important factor for the success of restoration programs; an inadequate origin can have negative impacts on genetic and adaptive processes. A technique that allows authenticating the origin is infrared spectroscopy, a fast, accurate and low-cost tool. In Patagonia one species that required restoration programs, consequently, propagules traceability is Araucaria araucana. Phylogeographic studies showed significant differences between Chilean Andean and Coastal populations. The goal of this study was to discriminate the phylogeographic origin of A. araucana seedlings using spectroscopic and chemometric methods. Seedlings of both phylogeographic origins were cultivated in common garden and spectral information in four spectral ranges was recorded. Principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) were applied. All the spectral ranges analyzed were able to discriminate phylogeographic origin, whose predictive models achieved a classification accuracy of 88–91%. The best models were SIMCA VIS–NIR and SIMCA FTIR. Wavelengths responsible for discrimination were associated with photosynthetic pigments, proteins and plant fibers. Andean seedlings have a higher content of Chlb, xanthophylls and plant fibers and the most important bands for the Coastal provenance are related to Chla and protein contents. It is shown that differences reported at the genetic level between both origins are expressed at the chemical level. In conclusion, infrared spectra obtained from Araucaria araucana, treated with chemometric methods, allow capturing the phylogeographic signal that separates Coastal and Andean origins. In the future, the resulting models could be used in restoration programs for this species.@@@Traceability

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare, debilitating and fatal disease, mostly characterized by progressive axonal peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis is still challenging and diagnostic delay in non-endemic area is about 3–4 years. The aim of this study was to arrange a clinical and electrophysiological score to select patients with axonal neuropathy that deserve screening for TTR mutation.

Methods

Thirty-five ATTRv patients and 55 patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and electrophysiological findings at first evaluation were collected. Based on significant results between the two groups, a compound (clinical and electrophysiological) score was arranged, and ROC analysis was performed to identify the ideal cut-off able to discriminate between the two groups.

Results

ATTRv patients presented a later age at onset, more frequent muscle weakness and carpal tunnel syndrome history. On the other hand, electrophysiological analysis showed that ATTRv patients had lower CMAP and SAP amplitude in all examined nerves. We arranged a compound score constituted by 7 total items, ranging from 0 to 12. ROC analysis showed an Area Under the Curve = 0.8655 and we set the cut-off ≥ 5 points to discriminate ATTRv patients with a sensitivity of 96.6% and a specificity of 63.6%.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that our compound score with cut-off ≥ 5 allows to discriminate ATTRv patients among subject affected by axonal polyneuropathy with a sensitivity > 95%. Thus, our compound score is a quick, easy and effective screening tool.@@@TTR amyloidosis

Since Betula platyphylla, B. ermanii and B. maximowicziana are economically and ecologically important forestry trees in boreal areas of Japan, meaningful conservation efforts require the development of cryopreservation methods for the winter buds of Japanese birch genetic resources. This study investigated the cryopreservation of winter buds of Japanese birch by slow freezing. Regrowth rates of shoot primordia isolated from winter buds that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (− 196 °C) after slow freezing from − 2 to − 40 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min were comparable with regrowth rates of shoot primordia that were not subjected to slow freezing and cryopreservation. Isolated shoot primordia of B. platyphylla showed regrowth rates of approximately 80%, and the regrowth rates of isolated shoot primordia of B. ermanii and B. maximowicziana were approximately 30%. Prevention of fungal contamination was technically difficult when preparing tissue cultures from B. ermanii and B. maximowicziana buds under sterile conditions. Assessments of freezing adaptation by differential thermal analysis showed that birch buds responded to subzero temperatures by extracellular freezing, which is a common mechanism for winter freezing adaptation in many plant tissues, but is different from deep supercooling associated with extraorgan freezing observed in the winter buds of many tree species. Since birch buds could tolerate immersion in liquid nitrogen by extracellular freezing, slow freezing of winter buds is considered to be a feasible method for preparing birch buds for cryopreservation.@@@Birch (Betula)

However, the country’s northern region lacks such crops to meet the demand of the second-largest national steel pole. The species is a promising source of biomass, as it is native to the region and grows at high rates. Thus, this research aimed to evaluate the effect of planting spacing (4.5, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5, and 12 m2 per plant), tree age (87 and 102 months) and stem forking on dendrometric variables and wood basic density of T. vulgaris trees from a trial plantation located in Eastern Amazonia. The commercial volume, basic density, form factor, and dry wood mass of trees were determined. The forked trees had a higher volume (0.2492 m3) and dry wood mass (112.88 kg) than non-forked trees (average volume of 0.1573 m3 and 73.66 kg of dry wood mass). At 87 months, wood basic density was found higher in wide spacings (9 and 12 m2 plant− 1). At 87 months, the non-forked and forked trees presented basic densities of 0.505 and 0.474 g cm− 3, respectively. The forked trees at 102 months spaced by 9 m2 had a basic density > 0.500 g cm− 3, a desirable parameter for charcoal production. Thus, this study confirmed the relevance of planting spacing, age, and stem type on the basic density of T. vulgaris, supporting future studies to define the best silvicultural practices and decision-making on the species by forest companies located in Amazonia.@@@Wood quality

Seedlings with and without root deformation were placed under high and low light intensity (21.6 and 0.66 mol m−2 day−1, respectively). Stem diameter (D), height (H), and leaves, stems, root, and total dry mass were measured. Analysis of covariance was used to test whether the relationship between seedling biomass and D2 or D2H varied for each treatment combination. Low light influenced the allometric relationship between biomass and D2 in stems. Root deformation with low light influenced the relationship between biomass and D2 in the root. Light and root deformation influenced the relationship between biomass and D2H in all seedling vegetative structures. As a result, “full” allometric models, which varied with treatment combinations, were equally accurate and precise at predicting biomass than “reduced” models, which did not vary with treatment for leaves and total dry mass using D2. However, “full” and “reduced” allometric models using D2H had the opposite effect as “full” models were more accurate and precise at predicting leaves and total biomass than “reduced” models. Our results showed that some allometric relationships of young G. americana plants were directly affected by root deformation and low light intensity, while some were conservative i.e. unaffected by light and root deformation treatments. The best allometric equations were obtained with models that used stem diameter as the predictor variable.@@@Allometry

We argue here that both fields have much to offer forestry and the success of each is intimately tied to the other. The major purposes of genetic engineering in forestry are described as well as the importance of evaluating tree engineering initiatives in the context of tree improvement and silviculture and integrating genetic engineering with tree breeding from start to finish. A generalized approach is developed that meets these requirements and demonstrates the interrelationships between the activities and phases of each program. In addition, a case study of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is provided to underscore the value of integrating genetic engineering and tree breeding programs to achieve a long-term conservation goal.@@@Forest genetics

However, the impact real on the nutritional sustainability of forest sites because to utilization of belowground biomass is not known. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of utilization of above and belowground biomass components on the nutritional sustainability of Eucalyptus clonal plantation. To do so, we used Eucalyptus urophylla clones (AEC 0144); E. urophylla × E. grandis (AEC 0224), and E. urophylla × E. camaldulensis (VM01) aged 6.8, 6.6, and 6.3 years of age, respectively. Trees were felled, up-rooted, and separated into leaves, branches, bark, stem wood, stumps, crown root, and coarse roots. Biomass production, stock, and export of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were analyzed. Moreover, the number of rotations required to export all soil nutrients, and nutrient use efficiency in different harvest systems were determined. The complete tree and full tree harvest systems exported the highest N, P, K, Ca, and Mg amounts, and showed the lowest nutrient use efficiency. This shows the importance of maintaining waste, such as leaves, branches, and bark, on the site. In harvest system debarked stem wood with belowground biomass, intermediate values were obtained in terms of export, use efficiency and number of rotations required to export N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, when compared to other harvest systems. These results showed that the belowground biomass use, taking into consideration Eucalyptus clone selection, and harvest systems can be an alternative source of biomass, without reducing the forest site sustainability and future productivity.@@@Eucalypt

However, the specific impact of Senecio on soil moisture dynamics and inducement of water stress in newly planted tree seedlings across varying site conditions has not been quantified. This study quantified these interactions at three contrasting sites across the U.S. Pacific Northwest: the Coastal Range, the Cascade foothills, and the fringe of south-central valley of Western Oregon. We tested whether competition between Senecio and Douglas-fir seedlings for soil water resources in areas of high Senecio abundance caused increased water stress in the tree seedlings. Senecio demonstrated a high degree of plasticity across sites increasing its lifespan and shoot:root in response to increased soil water resources. Senecio also had more than twice the root area of influence as Douglas-fir. Overall, greater Senecio abundance was associated with greater soil moisture depletion and this soil moisture depletion was correlated with increased Douglas-fir water stress. The magnitude of this response varied across sites; the dry site had the greatest shifts in Senecio biomass partitioning, the highest observable water depletion, and the greatest amount of Douglas-fir water stress. The presented results can be useful for determining effective forest vegetation management regimes by considering the impact of Senecio presence on Douglas-fir seedling drought stress across different site conditions.@@@Vegetation management

However, biomass allocation and nutrient use efficiency remain largely unknown under the interactive effect of irrigation and fertilization for many economically important conifer species. In this study, we compared biomass allocation and resources use efficiency of two-year-old (plug+1) containerized balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L) Mill.] ‘Cooks’ and concolor fir [Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. Ex Hildebr.] ‘Cibola’, and one-year-old bare-root white pine [Pinus strobus L.] transplants grown under variable watering and fertilization conditions. In a controlled greenhouse setting, transplants were submitted to three irrigation levels and two fertilization rates in a factorial experimental design. Fir species, mainly concolor fir, had a greater capacity to utilize water resulting in decreased stem water potential than white pine, leading to increased aboveground growth and shoot-to-root (S/R) ratio. White pine transplants had a higher assimilatory nutrient efficiency, nutrient use efficiency (NUE), root weight ratio, and a lower nitrogen availability index than the two fir species, suggesting a better ability to tolerate water stress. The high rates of fertilization increased nutrient concentration more than growth, suggesting luxury consumption. These results indicate that white pine responds to drought stress by closing their stomata and decreasing their S/R ratio to limit physiological activities, while the two fir species exhibit increased water uptake via expanded fine root networks, increasing the NUE and S/R ratio. However, there was no clear trend for the irrigation and fertilization interaction for NUE for three species, making it difficult to generalize responses.@@@Abies balsamea

This work investigates the effect of thinning spatial pattern on the response to pre-commercial thinning of dense Aleppo pine post-fire stands. On three replicated experimental sites in SE Spain, we applied the following treatments: 600 trees/ha, regular thinning pattern (600R), with residual trees evenly spaced; 600 trees/ha, aggregated thinning pattern (600A), with residual pines arranged in clumps of ∽25 trees with a local within-clump density of 2500 trees/ha; and control treatment, with no thinning applied (> 20,000 trees/ha). We assessed treatment effects on pine growth, size-growth relationships, soil water content, and understory vegetation over the first three years after thinning application. Both regular and aggregated thinning pattern similarly increased pine radial growth. In general, dbh growth rates in response to thinning were faster for smaller trees than for larger trees. The growth rate of pine height was higher for 600R and control than for 600A, indicating a positive effect on height of both low and very high pine densities. We found a near-term positive effect of aggregated pattern on water availability at the stand level, mostly resulting from enhanced soil water content in the canopy gaps. For both thinning patterns, the recovery of understory vegetation was dominated by resprouter species. This study highlights the potential of aggregated thinning patterns to enhance the complexity and heterogeneity of the pine stands without compromising pine growth, which could be of great use to managing pine forests in Mediterranean areas.@@@Mediterranean forests

Reports on long-term survival and growth response of longleaf pine to commonly used HWC herbicides and spring first year application timings are limited. The objectives of this study were (1) evaluate survival and growth of longleaf pine in response to three common herbicides, (2) evaluate three HWC application timings, and (3) determine if defect and disease prevalence are increased by faster growth rates following banded, overtop HWC treatments. Three study areas were installed as randomized complete block designs in Treutlen and Laurens County, Georgia, USA. Imazapyr [Arsenal® Applicators Concentrate (AC)] (A4 treatment) was applied during late March, mid-April, and mid-May of the first growing season, and a premixed blend of hexazinone and sulfometuron methyl (Oustar®) (10OS treatment) was applied on the same dates. The last treatment was a split application of sulfometuron methyl (Oust XP®) and imazapyr (2OA4 treatment). Survival post-establishment was greatest in the control treatment (no HWC) when the March application timing was included in the analysis, but with March timings removed, the 10OS treatment had the greatest survival after 11 years (April and May applications). March application timing resulted in significantly lower survival than April or May applications with 10OS and A4 treatments. Diameter and height were greatest in the 10OS and 2OA4 treatment, while the 10OS and control treatment had the greatest average green weight and basal area ha−1 at age 11-years-old. When herbaceous weeds present competition issues in newly established longleaf pine stands, the 10OS treatment applied in April or May on similar Coastal Plain sites may offer satisfactory long-term longleaf pine growth.@@@Reforestation

However, the effects of P fertilization as a strategy to improve the survival, growth and photosynthesis-related traits of Amazonian tree species in P-limited soils remain unclear. Here, we investigate how contrasting levels of P fertilization affect the establishment of native Amazonian tree species with different successional statuses. We measured the survival, growth (height and root collar diameter) and leaf traits (e.g., chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, leaf nutrients and gas exchange) of ten species (five pioneers and five nonpioneers) subjected to contrasting P supplies (−P = 0 kg P2O5 ha−1 and +P = 160 kg P2O5 ha−1) in the field over 24 months. Phosphorus fertilization improved the availability of P in the soil. Pioneers species were more responsive to fertilization. Erythrina fusca showed high mortality under −P, while Cedrela fissilis, Cordia alliodora and Guazuma ulmifolia (pioneers) exhibited the highest increases in growth rates after fertilization. Fertilization improved the P content in the leaves in the noonpioneers group, while both ecological groups had the highest K content in the leaves under no P fertilization. Carbon capture (stomatal conductance) increased only in pioneers species. Conversely, positive effects on carbon assimilation at the leaf level were not observed. P fertilization reduced the P use efficiency of nonpioneers species. Fertilization is an important management practice to relieve the effects of stress induced by soil phosphorus starvation on the establishment of Amazonian trees and is modulated by successional status and species identity.@@@Growth

A major bottleneck in the implementation of these systems is the damage caused, to forest species, by the application of herbicides for weed control in the crop component. The present study evaluated the selectivity of herbicides in seedlings of two tree species native to the Brazilian Cerrado, Dipteryx alata (Vog.) and Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul, and two eucalyptus clones, E. urograndis and E. urocam. The study was conducted in a greenhouse, with two commonly-used herbicides (glyphosate and mesotrione), in five different doses. The sensitivity of tree species to the herbicides was evaluated through physiological, morphological and visual phyto intoxication characteristics. For glyphosate, the tree species exhibited strong phytotoxicity symptoms from the second day after application, being the symptoms more prominent in the two eucalyptus clones and less in D. alata, which presented higher tolerance to this herbicide. For mesotrione, the four tree species studied showed mild toxicity symptoms, with very little or absent significant impacts in growth and biomass accumulation. The herbicide mesotrione was shown to be selective for the four tree species studied and can be recommended to agroforestry systems in which these species are present. These results based on phytotoxicity grades are reinforced by the biometric and physiological parameters measured.@@@Dipteryx alata

We investigated different early growth responses of genotypes of Eucalyptus globulus (7), E. nitens (3), and E. nitens × E globulus (E. gloni) (7) in south-central Chile. To evaluate seasonal growth, plants of each genotype were established in a completely randomized block design in coarse sandy soil (i.e., low water holding capacity), with spring and summer irrigation. The current monthly increment (CMI) in wood volume (cm3 tree−1 month−1), and leaf area index (LAI, m2 m−2) were used to calculate GE at 4.1, 7.5, 10.4, 13.4, and 15.4 months of age, corresponding to five growing seasons (first summer, fall, winter, spring, and second summer). The interaction between genotype and season had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on LAI and GE, but not on CMI. In general, CMI values declined in winter, but increased greatly in the second summer. LAI values were stable during the first three seasons, increased in spring, and peaked in the second summer. During all seasons, a significant (p < 0.001) relationship between growth and LAI was observed, with differences in model coefficients among taxa. The highest GEs were observed mainly for E. globulus, which grew with small changes in the LAI. In general, our findings showed that eucalyptus genotypes with higher annual GEs presented higher seasonal GEs, except for some E. globulus genotypes. Changes in seasonal GEs among genotypes suggest that the same environment drives a significant response in the early growth stage as a consequence of climate influences on carbon allocation among different eucalyptus genotypes.@@@Leaf area index

However, nursery-grown seedlings often exhibit poor performance after outplanting due to the lack of adaptation to harsh natural conditions. These nursery-grown seedlings do not necessarily possess well-developed ectomycorrhizal symbionts, which help to obtain nutrients and increase resilience in exchange for seedling photoassimilated carbon. To improve the quality of the seedlings in natural conditions, we sowed spruce seeds on growing media with the addition of wood chips, i.e. stemwood chips or polyphenol- and resin acid-rich knotwood chips. Wood chips were chosen because they are common forest side-streams, and their compounds have shown a potential to improve mycorrhization and seedling fitness. Wood chips initially decreased the growth of seedlings. However, this effect levelled off with time and depended on the quality of the wood. Wood chips had no effect on mycorrhization. Further testing of the wood material showed that wood chips seemed to decrease seedling growth via nitrogen (N) immobilisation rather than a direct toxic effect. The phenomenon of N immobilisation on wood chips could be explored further to develop a slow-release N source, aptly reflecting N availability in natural conditions. Slow-release N source based on wood chips could be beneficial both to increase survival in natural conditions and for environment protection.@@@Forest nursery

To improve plant adaptation to new environments, the first step is breeding programs and/or forming base populations of new and different species. But, to achieve this, what species should be chosen from the almost 1000 existing eucalypt species? To tackle this question, this work evaluated various eucalypt species from different provenances at two assessment in five environments to verify (1) the need for environmental stratification; (2) the best species and provenances per environment, and (3) environmental stability, adaptability, and changes between assessment. The mortality and diameter at breast height of 27 eucalypt taxa originating from wild populations and seed orchards were evaluated. To evaluate the data, we took a factor analytic mixed modelling approach to define mega-environments (groups of similar sites) and characterize the interactions of these with the selected taxa. The analyses allowed both quantitative and graphical identification of optimal combinations of species and sites. Promising taxa identified include Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata, C. henryi, Eucalyptus longirostrata, E. major and E. urophylla. We place the results of this process in the context of ongoing domestication and breeding of new taxa for challenging sites in Brazil.@@@Early selection

The objective of this study was to use a thermal time approach to determine whether primary dormancy levels in seeds were correlated with mean ambient temperature during temperature-sensitive phases of the reproductive cycle. Seedlots were obtained from a single open-pollinated clonal seed orchard in five crop years and germinated over a wide temperature range (7–35 °C) to calculate base temperature for germination with and without pre-chills (4 and 8 weeks). Primary dormancy levels varied amongst seedlots collected in different crop years (CY). Unchilled seeds were the most dormant for CY2007 (Tb = 10.9 °C) and least dormant for CY2012 (Tb = 5.6 °C). Base temperatures for germination were correlated with mean ambient temperature during different phases of the reproductive cycle. There was a strong positive correlation between base temperature for germination of unchilled seeds and mean temperature during pollination and early pollen tube growth. This suggests that maternal environmental effects during this phase could potentially select for dormant or non-dormant seeds, which has implications for tree breeding and seedling production in forest nurseries.@@@Epigenetics

Many CB detection systems have been developed for many natural languages to face this phenomenon. However, Arabic is one of the under-resourced languages suffering from the lack of quality datasets in many computational research areas. This paper discusses the design, construction, and evaluation of a multi-dialect, annotated Arabic Cyberbullying Corpus (ArCybC), a valuable resource for Arabic CB detection and motivation for future research directions in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP). The study describes the phases of ArCybC compilation. By way of illustration, it explores the corpus to discover strategies used in rendering Arabic CB tweets pulled from four Twitter groups, including gaming, sports, news, and celebrities. Based on thorough analysis, we discovered that these groups were the most susceptible to harassment and cyberbullying. The collected tweets were filtered based on a compiled harassment lexicon, which contains a list of multi-dialectical profane words in Arabic compiled from four categories: sexual, racial, physical appearance, and intelligence. To annotate ArCybC, we asked five annotators to classify 4,505 tweets into two classes manually: Offensive/non-Offensive and CB/non-CB. We conducted a rigorous comparison of different machine learning approaches applied on ArCybC to detect Arabic CB using two language models: bag-of-words (BoW) and word embedding. The experiments showed that Support Vector Machine (SVM) with word embedding achieved an accuracy rate of 86.3% and an F1-score rate of 85%. The main challenges encountered during the ArCybC construction were the scarcity of freely available Arabic CB texts and the deficiency of annotating the texts.@@@Annotated cyberbullying corpus

While research has highlighted the ecological potential of mixed-species plantations, studies on the economic viability and management of such plantations are largely missing in the context of tropical plantation forestry. In this study, we estimated the economic potential and optimized the management of commercial mixed-species plantations of four tree species native to Central America (Dalbergia retusa, Dipteryx oleifera, Hieronyma alchorneoides, and Vochysia guatemalensis) and Teak (Tectona grandis). We combined the forest growth model 3-PGmix and detailed economic data for two plantation sites in Costa Rica to optimize the management of 11 different mixtures using a genetic optimization algorithm. We found that several of the modeled mixed-species stands can be highly profitable with net present values (NPV) up to 4821.2 USD/ha at an 8% discount rate, and internal rates of return up to 17% (under excellent site conditions). This indicates that the most profitable mixtures (e.g. of V. guatemalensis-D. oleifera or T. grandis-D. oleifera on excellent sites) could compete economically with conventional monoculture plantations such as Teak monocultures. Further, mixed stands can be managed based on the same simple even-aged management approaches currently applied in monoculture plantations if the specific management parameters are adapted. The optimized management parameters also lead to improved NPV of the modeled stands under alternative valuation assumptions but are site-specific. In the present study, we only considered financial benefits from timber production. However, establishing mixed-species plantations in the tropics could provide a wide range of ecosystem services including climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.@@@Reforestation

"1285","Morphological characteristics and germination of native species seeds for mineland rehabilitation in the Eastern Amazon@@@@@@Received: 20 October 2021 Accepted: 12 September 2022 Published: 22 September 2022@@@The lack of knowledge about seeds of native species constitutes a major challenge to their use in environmental rehabilitation activities. In this study, we analysed the morphology and germination of native species seeds found in areas close to Fe and Mn mines in the Eastern Amazon. We also evaluated the effect of scarification on seeds showing natural low germination. Seeds of 39 native species varying in ecological succession, biological cycle, and growth habits were tested. The pre-germination treatments of the seeds consisted of abrasion (mechanical scarification), immersion in sulfuric acid (90%) (chemical scarification), and immersion in hot water (100 °C) (thermal scarification). The results showed that (i) seed size and mass varied greatly between species of the same growth habit, particularly in shrubs and trees, as well as within species, for nine species; (ii) an overall low germination percentage for non-scarified seeds; (iii) an increment of ~ threefold in germination percentage and 11-fold in germination speed after mechanical seed coat scarification; (iv) and 17 of the 18 legume species analyzed showed low germination percentages, which indicates some type of dormancy. The size of the seeds had a low relationship with germination, being more related to the ecological characteristics of the species. After mechanical scarification, the tree species showed the greatest increase in germination compared to the other groups. The mechanical scarification can contribute to improving the performance of native species in the revegetation of mining areas in the Amazon, however, complementary studies are needed to better understand these species and optimize their use.@@@Plant propagation

With an expected increase in the prevalence of drought in some forested areas, climate change increases concerns about future seedling growth. A promising approach to promote the suitability of plantation seedlings to current and future climate would be to use variation in growth and wood traits of trees under drought as selection criteria in tree breeding programs, especially at a young stage when they are most vulnerable to drought. We evaluated the genetic control of the growth and wood density response of white spruce clonal seedlings submitted to various drought conditions in a greenhouse experiment. By varying the watering treatment of 600 two year-old seedlings from 25 clones, we simulated three levels of drought-induced stress during two growing seasons. Apical and radial growth decreased markedly as the intensity of drought increased, whereas wood density tended to increase. We also developed a woody biomass index composed of wood density and ring area, which was observed to decrease slightly with increasing drought. There was important variation in all traits among clones and heritability tended to decrease with the intensity and duration of drought-induced stress, mainly for wood density and radial growth. However, the heritability of apical growth tended to increase under drought conditions. Our results show that the response of young white spruce clones to drought is highly variable, and together with the significant levels of heritability noted, the results indicate that multi-trait genetic selection for drought stress response at a young age could represent a promising approach to increase resilience to drought.@@@White spruce

Several major conifer species are affected, but such damage was mentioned for the first time in France for hybrid larch (Larix x eurolepis) in 1993. Even though a link was made with severe drought some years ago, it was believed, at that time, that the rapid growth of hybrids might be the cause. Our study is intended to disentangle the role of growth versus drought in the appearance of cracks, based on observations in two field genetic trials. Summer drought was clearly identified as the main trigger of longitudinal cracks. Roughly 5–15 years of age seems to be the critical period during which the occurrence of most of the cracks was observed. Wood formed during this period corresponds to juvenile wood, well-known for its weaknesses. Nevertheless, some trees escaped cracking damage: compared to trees with cracks, these looked slender (higher HD ratio), had wider rings and greater grain angle in the early years but similar wood density. Fast growth has often been cited as enhancing crack occurrence. This conclusion is corroborated by our observations that, within a given variety or family, trees with cracks were consistently larger than trees without cracks. Nevertheless, this conclusion should be qualified by the additional observation that, across varieties/families, the faster growing material were not necessarily the most prone to cracks, highlighting the crucial role of the genetic background of the material planted.@@@Larix

Supply of Ca and S via application of dolomitic limestone and gypsum may stimulate root development (in terms of depth) and also enhance access to water stored in the subsurface layers. Aerial and root growth, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and S–SO42− migration, and soil profile of Eucalyptus urophylla were evaluated following dolomitic limestone and gypsum application. Five treatments were used: (i) no application of Ca2+, Mg2+, and S–SO42− sources (CONTROL); (ii) 1200 kg ha−1 of gypsum (GYP); (iii) 2000 kg ha−1 of dolomitic limestone (DOL); (iv) DOL plus 1200 kg ha−1 of gypsum (DOL + GYP); and (v) DOL plus 2400 kg ha−1 of gypsum (DOL + 2GYP). Compared with CONTROL, Gypsum and dolomitic limestone application in DOL + 2GYP increased the concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the soil surface and of S–SO42− in the subsurface by five, four, and three times, respectively. Fertilization with gypsum alone or in combination with dolomitic limestone did not promote an increase in fine root density (FRD) in the deeper layers. Concentrations of Ca, S, and K in the leaves increased by 16–43%. Furthermore, applying limestone 49 months after planting increased E. urophylla whole wood volume and the mean annual increment (MAI) by 8%, as compared to those in the CONTROL. Thus, gypsum and dolomitic limestone positively impacted soil fertility and may be used to acclimatize Eucalyptus to water-deficit conditions.@@@Cations

Although the image recognition capabilities and deep neural network (DNN) have developed rapidly in recent years, relevant studies have confirmed that DNN will be attacked by well-crafted images, resulting in model recognition errors. The adversarial examples generated by the traditional black-box attack are not smooth enough and have poor transferability. We note that the interpretive method of neural network may help us find the focus of neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, in order to reduce the distortion of the adversarial examples and improve the transferability. We take advantage of softmax gradient layer-wise relevance propagation (SGLRP) in distinguishing which pixels have made important contributions in classification to guide the neural network to focus on the wrong regions by providing relevance scores, and perform experiments on a series of classical deep neural networks. The results demonstrate that by minimizing the loss function composed of the SGLRP objective function based on cosine similarity, we can effectively generate transferable adversarial examples with high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR, 33.0554dB) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM, 0.9617), achieving an average fooling rate of more than 87.53% on several DNNs. Compared with traditional attack methods, the proposed attack schema focus more on the common semantic features of DNNs, shows good transferability and the ability of generating high-quality adversarial examples.@@@Adversarial attack

At the World Forestry Congress in 1991 a five-step species distribution modelling process was outlined to develop “a global climatological audit to assist conservation and sustainable development” of natural and plantation forests under climate change. This described a framework for gathering and using information from tree species natural distributions and ex situ trials to assist forest management in the context of climate change. This perspective paper briefly outlines progress in the five areas. It highlights the need for increased action at the global scale on collating data from past and present trials including common gardens.

Roots are the plant organs least resistant to cavitation and, due to this, root hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation have been proposed as an additional element for seedling quality evaluations. This trait, however, has been poorly characterized for important conifer species preventing the integration of this important physiological trait into criteria for genetic selection and nursery production. In the first part of this study, we modified the original design of the vacuum chamber method allowing for measurements of the whole root system of young conifer seedlings. This method was then compared with standard gravimetric measurements for stems of four tree species and our results confirmed that the vacuum chamber is a reliable technique to measure hydraulic conductance. We were able to perform up to 50 measurements per day of hydraulic conductance of whole root systems using a team of two people, opening the possibility for large scale assessments of root hydraulics, including genetic screening. In the second part of the study, the vacuum chamber method was used to assess the impact of nursery irrigation regime and seedling age on coastal Douglas-fir stem and whole root system hydraulic conductance. When coastal Douglas-fir seedlings grew under limited water availability, roots and stems both experienced a 65% reduction in xylem hydraulic conductance. In contrast to this, Douglas-fir seedling water transport efficiency was reduced more in roots than stems when seedlings were grown under well-watered conditions.@@@Pseudotsuga mensiezii

Roots display extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in environmental conditions, which can be harnessed through management to produce seedlings with desirable root traits for better field performance. This systematic review synthesizes research on the effects of nutrients, light, soil temperature, water availability, and their interactions on seedling root system development and architecture in nursery production and field establishment. Major findings show that nutrient and water availability have the greatest potential for regulating root system development and architecture. High nutrient availability increases overall root growth, branching, and rooting depth until plants reach nutrient sufficiency that may cause root growth inhibition. Drought preconditioning (i.e., exposure to drought stress in the nursery) effects vary widely, but generally reduces seedling size and promotes root vs. shoot growth. Soil temperature and light availability can control seedling growth and influence stress resistance. For example, shading promotes shoot vs. root growth, while photoperiod reduction has the opposite effect. Forest tree species have an optimal temperature for root growth between 15 and 25 °C, outside of which, development is increasingly impaired. Furthermore, seedling morphology and physiology is often a result of additive or interactive effects among environmental factors. Interactions between nutrient availability and other environmental factors show the greatest potential to improve seedling root development and field performance. However, ecological differences among species and ecotypes and complex tradeoffs among trait expression can entangle the identification of clear trends among interacting environmental factors.@@@Drought preconditioning

Literature regarding sources of variation in root traits, relationships between root traits and seedling growth and survival, and root trait heritability estimates from published studies were used to illustrate the utility of combining myriad approaches to enhance the efficiency of tree seedling improvement programs. We found that: (1) evidence exists for genetic variation in numerous root traits, (2) root traits tend to have intermediate heritability on average, and (3) evidence supports the possibility of harnessing maternal effects to modify root traits at least temporarily. Across eight root traits from 11 studies, median family narrow-sense heritability estimates (h2) were intermediate (0.25 ≤ h2 ≤ 0.50) for root diameter, root count, root biomass, the ratio of root-to-stem dry biomass, and projected root area, and low (h2 < 0.25) for root length, specific root length, and the ratio of total belowground-to-aboveground dry biomass. Findings from this review suggest that plant improvement pipelines can be optimized to harness root trait variation due to genetics, maternal effects, and nursery cultural regimes. However, the following related gaps in the literature emerged as fundamental obstacles to progress: What is the duration of root system responses to stress conditioning treatments? Which root traits correlate best with seedling survival and thus should be prioritized for improvement? Is it possible to reliably harness variation in root traits resulting from maternal effects?@@@Heritability estimates

There is an array of practices nursery practitioners and foresters use to ensure seedlings develop quality root systems to aid in outplanting success. To this end, a select number of topics are examined on how they effect root system quality and the linkage between these culturing practices (i.e., nursery root culturing practices), good root morphological and physiological quality and successful field establishment. The following discussion first describes why root development is critical for seedlings to avoid planting stress and successfully transition into field establishment. This is followed by reviewing the seasonality of root growth patterns, and how nursery cultural practices that create optimum levels of nutrients and non-structural carbohydrates affect root growth. Bareroot and container-grown stocktypes are discussed in relation to how their ability to grow roots affects seedling establishment. Lastly, nursery practices related to bareroot root culturing and container type selection for container-grown seedlings are examined on how they can affect seedling root form and field establishment. By focussing on these topics, the intent was to gain a renewed perspective on the importance of root system quality to ensure seedling establishment after outplanting on a forest restoration site.@@@Root system quality

Such a root system can be generated using chemical root pruning by applying cupric carbonate (Cu) that can arrest the development of, or cause mortality to, root apical meristems resulting in the formation of new lateral roots with an overall increase in the biomass, length, and volume of the root system. Our objective was to investigate the effect of chemical root pruning on the morphological and architectural traits of adventitious roots produced by poplar cuttings (Populus nigra L.) grown in containers coated with Cu in various symmetrical (Side, Bottom, Side + Bottom) and asymmetrical (half side + half bottom) patterns. After six weeks, roots of the cuttings were extracted from different container depths (Top, Middle, and Bottom) and portions (non-coated, Cu-coated), and analyzed. The root systems reacted to all coating patterns by increasing length, biomass, volume, and average diameters, but magnitude of increase was further affected by depth. In particular, root growth was unaffected at the Top of the container, and length was the highest at the Bottom depth. The Middle depth had a significant increment in both biomass and volume. Also, the root population increased in diameter as a possible response to Cu exposure. Interestingly, in the asymmetrically coated containers this depth response in the non-coated portions was of higher magnitude than in the Cu-coated portions.@@@Root development

This technique was intended to promote more root egress after outplanting from the entire length of the root plug with a goal of providing greater stem stability. After excavating and digitizing the root systems of five treated and five non-treated plants, we observed that regardless of treatment, all trees initiated more roots and accumulated more root volume in apparent response to mechanical stresses invoked by wind and slope, with more roots occurring windward and downslope. Few differences were noted between treatments for root length and volume for either the cage or the entire root system. Trees treated with copper were taller (8%) with stouter taproots (less taper) and less root volume in the lower soil profile than control trees. Although the copper treatment may have induced short-term changes to root system architecture, the long-term, plastic response of this species to mechanical stresses, and the time duration involved, was more critical to the observed expression of traits.@@@Long-term effect

However, the belowground responses of subtropical trees to NH4+ or NO3− deposition in phosphorus-barren soil remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the effects of these two forms of N deposition on root development and experimentally analyze the impact on nitrogen and phosphorus absorption in two types of subtropical tree species (Schima superba; a broadleaved tree with a fibrous root system, and Pinus massoniana; a conifer with a taproot system). In a greenhouse in southern China, 1-year-old S. superba and P. massoniana seedlings grown on P-limited and P-normal soil were treated with NaNO3 and NH4Cl solutions of 0, 80, and 200 kg N ha−1 year−1, corresponding to the control, N80, and N200 groups, respectively. Root phenotype characteristics and metabolic ability were measured after 8 months of growth. The results showed that the root morphology and exudates variables differed significantly between the two species under different N and P treatments, and the root growth rate and P absorption were higher in P. massoniana. N addition differentially affected root growth and activity as follows: (1) N80 increased the root growth and activity of the two species, but NH4+-N80 led to thicker roots in S. superba compared with P. massoniana; (2) N200 had inhibitory effects on the roots of P. massoniana, for which NH4+-N200 led to thinner and longer roots and even the death of some roots; and (3) NH4+-N promoted phosphorus absorption efficiency and nitrogen absorption efficiency in the thicker roots (> 1.5 mm), and NO3−-N stimulated activity in the thinner roots (0.5–1.5 mm) of S. superba. The opposite was observed for P. massoniana. P. massoniana had a higher root absorption efficiency; however, nitrogen deposition was found to be more beneficial to the root growth of S. superba.@@@Ammonium NH4+

Longleaf pine ecosystems are considered more resilient than other southern pine ecosystems and the attributes that confer this resilience may be related to belowground carbon allocation patterns that occur during the seedling stage of its life history where it exists for years in a grass stage. The long residence time spent in the grass stage has impeded adoption of longleaf pine by landowners for decades, which has resulted in efforts to expedite emergence from the grass stage through silviculture, nursery production, and selection breeding techniques; however, expedited emergence may come at the expense of root and belowground carbohydrate storage reserve development—traits that purportedly enhance longleaf pine tree and ecosystem resilience relative to other southern pine species. Here, I caution that efforts to expedite longleaf pine emergence from the grass stage also consider the potential implications on belowground carbon allocation and identify research priorities to help facilitate the improvement of longleaf pine seedling silviculture, nursery production, and breeding in a way that ensures the maintenance of attributes linked to resilience.@@@Above- and belowground allocation

Seedlings of P. tabuliformis were subjected to 0, 3, 6, 12 g of N m−2 year−1, then growth parameters and hormone concentration (trans-zeatin riboside (ZR), gibberellin (GA1+3), indole acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA)) in leaf, stem, total root, coarse root (diameters > 2 mm), fine root (1–2 mm) and finest root (0–1 mm) were measured. The results showed that N addition increased the growth of all the plant organs, decreased the ratio of underground (the whole root) to aboveground (leaf and stem) growth, which is in line with the functional balance hypothesis. Additionally, N addition increased the ZR concentration in stems, while decreasing the ABA concentration in leaves and whole roots and the GA1+3 concentration in whole roots, but IAA concentration was not significantly influenced by N addition. Furthermore, the stem growth was mainly affected by the synergistic effect of ZR and GA1+3, while the leaf and total root growth was mainly impacted synergistically by ZR and IAA. Additionally, the root growth at each diameter class was also regulated by different hormones. In conclusion, N addition can change the distribution pattern of endogenous hormones in different plant organs and roots of different diameter classes, thereby regulating growth of Pinus seedlings, and the changes in growth are the result of the coordinated regulation of various hormones.@@@Nitrogen addition

This study applied ensemble learning methods to explore the plastic response of Eucalyptus nitens pulpwood selection traits of growth (DBH, diameter at 1.3 m height), wood density and Kraft pulp yield to variation in elevation, geography and associated climate variables. To help explain the pulp yield response, we also modelled underlying biological traits—cellulose, lignin and extractives. The study was based on data from 84 harvest-age plots of common genetic origin across the pulpwood plantation estate in north-western Tasmania, Australia. DBH and wood density were obtained from resistance profile traces, collected on standing trees using a drilling resistance tool. In addition, outerwood cores were taken at 1.3 m stem height for (i) calibrating the resistance measures for wood density, and (ii) for assessment of pulp yield and wood chemistry based on near infrared spectroscopy. Modelling of the variation in plot means using the random forest algorithms showed growth and wood properties were influenced by the growing period climate of the plot. Of the climate variables studied, growth was mainly influenced by temperature, while wood density was mainly affected by rainfall-related variables. Wood density varied independently of growth and decreased with increasing annual rainfall and elevation of the plots. Pulp yield had the poorest fit statistics, it was influenced by a mix of climatic and geographic variables, and appeared independent of variation in growth and wood density. The plot variation in pulp yield was best explained by the modelled trends in the underlying biological traits of cellulose and lignin. Using these models, the plastic response of the key pulpwood traits to climate was mapped across the E. nitens plantation estate to help predict current plantation attributes and guide future choices of sites for plantation establishment.@@@Eucalyptus nitens

The rare relict plant Metasequoia glyptostroboides is a difficult to natural regeneration and is affected by litter allelopathy. However, little is known about the potential influence of autotoxic substances on different regeneration stages of M. glyptostroboides. We identified multiple chemical compounds of aqueous extracts from fresh (recently accumulated) and natural litter (mixture of litter different phases of decomposition), to evaluate the autotoxic effects of the four most important detected compounds applied individually on seed germination and seedling growth of M. glyptostroboides. Results found that the 28 chemical compounds were identified in the aqueous extracts of M. glyptostroboides litter. The Jaccard similarity coefficient of chemical compounds in aqueous extracts of fresh and natural litter of M. glyptostroboides reached 50%. The number of chemical compounds in fresh litter was 5.56% more than that in natural litter. Catechol, trifluoroacetamide, benzoic acid and D-(+)-arabitol significantly affected seed germination rate, seed germination index, vigor index, shoot length and main root length of M. glyptostroboides. Specifically, benzoic acid had the strongest inhibitory effect, followed by catechol, trifluoroacetamide and D-(+)-arabitol. The autotoxic effect was concentration dependent, low concentrations were positive and neutral, high and extremely high concentrations were negative for all the chemical compounds. Moreover, catechol, trifluoroacetamide, benzoic acid and D-(+)-arabitol were autotoxic substances affecting the natural regeneration of M. glyptostroboides, as well as strongly inhibited at the shoot growth stage. This study confirms that natural regeneration of M. glyptostroboides is restricted by a large amount of litter coverage under the forest, highlighting how the chemical compounds responsible for the autotoxic characteristics of M. glyptostroboides affect the different regeneration stages of M. glyptostroboides.@@@Metasequoia glyptostroboides

Plant N uptake and assimilation influence species adaptation and distribution, yet intra-specific comparisons across environmental gradients are scarce. In this study, white birch (Betula platyphylla) seedlings from three Chinese provenances spanning a wide latitude and temperature gradient were cultivated with two inorganic (NO3 and NH4) and one organic (glycine) N forms. We evaluated seedling performance and N uptake for each N form, including the seedling's ability to uptake intact glycine using stable isotopes (13C and 15N). Our data show that both organic (glycine) and inorganic (NO3−) fertilization forms significantly promoted seedling growth and increased the concentration of N, potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) in plant tissues. However, NH4+ caused toxicity, evidenced by chlorosis and necrosis in the apex of old leaves, thereby limiting growth. Seedling growth increased with decreasing latitude, while nutrient concentrations in both shoots and roots decreased with decreasing latitude. Counter to traditional mineral nutrition theory, all seedlings took up intact glycine. Our study can help guide nursery fertilization practices and suggests that the climate of origin affects growth but does not substantially change the preferred N source.@@@White birch

Quantitatively assessing the impact of competitive vegetation on the growth of planted seedling is vital for reduction of weeding cost. This study compared the survival and growth of potentially fast-growing hybrid larch F1 seedling (Larix gmelinii var. japonica × L. kaempferi) with Japanese larch (L. kaempferi) at three competitive levels, which were 0–50%, 50–75% and 75–100% of the seedling surface covered by vegetation after planting. When more than three-quarters of the seedling surface was covered by vegetation, the survival rate of Japanese larch dropped substantially. In contrast, hybrid larch F1 sustained a high survival of 95% despite the high covering. Annual height growth significantly decreased with increasing coverage for both species. In addition, the height growth of hybrid larch F1 was significantly higher than that of Japanese larch, whereas the difference became insignificant when more than three-quarters of the surface was covered. If the requirement for weeding is whether three-quarters of the seedling surface is covered or not with vegetation, it was determined that hybrid larch F1 did not require weeding if the seedling height attained about 170 cm in the previous fall; whereas Japanese larch needed about 200 cm. The findings imply that weeding is needed to unlock the hybrid larch F1’s high growth potential, and that weeding can be accomplished more than a year earlier than with Japanese larch.@@@Competition

"1305","Climate and local factors influence Eucalyptus globulus establishment after off-season fires@@@@@@Received: 03 November 2021 Accepted: 08 November 2022 Published: 24 November 2022@@@Eucalyptus globulus Labill. is one of the most widely planted hardwood species worldwide. This species occupies a quarter of the country's forested area in Portugal, so there is a growing concern about its post-fire dispersal. Although it is generally recognised that fire promotes E. globulus natural regeneration and that precipitation and topography influence recruitment, little is known about the role of post-fire conditions on the establishment of the species following off-season fires. We examine how post-fire conditions affect E. globulus natural regeneration and invasive potential. Sapling establishment was assessed in plantations and under old and large isolated eucalyptus trees (seed-trees) following two off-season fire events (2017 June and October fires). Abiotic and biotic local factors affected differently sapling establishment in plantations and under seed-trees. In plantations, sapling cover was more influenced by tree-related traits (age and height), whereas the conditions beneath seed-trees mitigated the impact of harsh conditions on saplings. In both cases, post-fire climatic conditions constrained natural regeneration, with less impact under seed-trees, reinforcing their importance in establishment success. Thus, isolated seed-trees should be considered while managing the species’ unplanned spread.@@@Forest fires

"1306","Applicability of in vitro clonal hedge in the vegetative propagation of Eucalyptus urophylla@@@@@@Received: 19 May 2021 Accepted: 15 November 2022 Published: 28 November 2022@@@The most used method for the production of plantlets of the Eucalyptus has been the mini-cutting. Productivity in this system is closely linked to environmental and management conditions, with problems related to loss of physiological vigor and low rooting rates being common. In vitro culture techniques offer many advantages to the plantlets production, including the uniformity among propagules; multiplication of clones in reduced space and time; and the greater nutritional, environmental, and phytosanitary control. However, in vitro propagation is still a process that causes some stress to plants and also has limitations for commercial-scale use regarding clonal Eucalyptus production. In vitro clonal hedge is proposed to overcome some difficulties in the vegetative propagation found in the mini-clonal hedge located in forest nurseries adding the advantages of in vitro propagation, including photoautotrophic cultivation, to the conventional production technique by mini-cutting. This study compares the productivity of mini-stumps/micro-stumps of the Eucalyptus urophylla clone in two cultivation systems: the mini-clonal hedge located ex vitro, and the in vitro clonal hedge located in a tissue culture laboratory. Shoot production, rooting and mini-cuttings/micro-cuttings’ survival were evaluated. The production of mini-cuttings/micro-cuttings by mini-stump/micro-stump was similar, but the productivity per area was higher in the in vitro clonal hedge. In both systems, high survival and rooting rates were observed. However, the in vitro clonal hedge systems aim to provide a new way of propagating vegetative plants, which should be further studied and improved to become an alternative to the mini-clonal hedge for the production of clonal Eucalyptus plantlets.@@@Micropropagation

"1307","Overcoming limitations to propagation from seed of 40 Australian species important for restoration@@@@@@Received: 27 April 2022 Accepted: 08 November 2022 Published: 01 December 2022@@@High standards in managing the seed-supply chain, emphasizing sourcing and seed storage, are crucial to maintaining seed viability and ultimately to meeting restoration goals. The germination of 40 plant species was investigated in response to difficulties experienced by restoration practitioners in propagating them from seed in nurseries and in direct seeding. The species were from a biodiversity hotspot in inland eastern Australia and spanned a range of life-forms. The initial constraint identified was poor seed viability, which varied widely within and between species but was < 50% in at least one seedlot of 36 species. Low seed viability was indicated by poor seed storage and processing practices, manifest in excessive storage time, herbivory, fungal infection, and inadequate seed collection and processing (e.g. collection of immature seed and overcleaning). The main reason for low germination of viable species was seed dormancy. Dormancy was identified in 16 species: pre-sowing treatments in these species were effective in relieving dormancy or increasing germination percentage by two to three-fold. The most frequent pre-sowing treatment required was scarification. Stratification, de-husking and leaching also increased germination in some species. Temperature conditions for high germination were also investigated. Seasonal temperature treatments affected germination in 22 species. The results emphasize the necessity for (1) testing seed before use; (2) identifying temperature ranges to achieve maximum germination; (3) identifying species with germination constraints, and (4) using suitable pre-sowing treatments for plant propagation in nurseries and potentially in the field.@@@Dormancy

"1308","Dispersion-theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of the \(\Lambda \) hyperon@@@@@@Received: 07 September 2022 Accepted: 21 November 2022 Published: 03 December 2022@@@The electromagnetic form factors of the \(\Lambda \) hyperon in the time-like region are determined precisely through a dispersion-theoretical analysis of the world data for the cross section of the annihilation process \(e^+e^-\rightarrow {\bar{\Lambda }}{\Lambda }\). The spectral function is represented by a superposition of narrow and broad vector meson poles. We test different scenarios for the spectral function and obtain a good description of the world data in the time-like region. The uncertainties in the extracted form factors are estimated by means of the bootstrap sampling method. The analytical continuation of the form factors to the space-like region introduces large errors due to the lack of data. When the electric \(\Lambda \) radius from chiral perturbation theory is taken as a constraint, the magnetic radius is predicted as \(r_M = 0.681 \pm 0.002\) fm. We also extract various vector meson to baryon coupling constants.@@@"
