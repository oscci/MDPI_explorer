A lot has happened since this repository/guide was published, including an awesome collaboration with Mark Hanson, Paolo Crosetto and Dan Brockington exploring the current Strain on Scientific Publishing [Link to project] [Link to preprint]. Initially, the repository was a collection of scripts to explore MDPI journals. Now, is been transformed into a full R package, with 2 functions to obtain data, 4 to plot this data and several datasets to play with."

    "text": "Data extracting functions\njournal_papers(): This function looks into the target journal sitemap and returns a vector containing all journal papers URLs. To use it, it requires a string with the code name of the target journal:\n\nurls&lt;-journal_papers(\"agriculture\")\n\nThe journal code name usually coincides with the journal title, but this is not always the case. To find the code name for your journal of interest check the dataset MDPI_journals, included in the package:\n\nMDPI_journals|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n                               name            code\n1                         Acoustics       acoustics\n2                         Actuators       actuators\n3           Administrative Sciences          admsci\n4                       Adolescents     adolescents\n5  Advances in Respiratory Medicine             arm\n6                       Aerobiology     aerobiology\n7                         Aerospace       aerospace\n8                       Agriculture     agriculture\n9                   AgriEngineering agriengineering\n10                    Agrochemicals   agrochemicals\n\n\narticles_info(): Uses the vector, or a sample from the vector obtained via journal_papers() to web scrap article data, outputting a data frame. The function requires the user to enter a delay (in seconds) between scraping instances. This is useful to not get blocked by the scraped server (suggested time = 2 seconds). Additionally, it is possible to scrap a random sample of the total of papers.\n\n#Will scrape all url values leaving 2 seconds between iterations\ndata&lt;-articles_info(urls,2) \n\n#Will scrape 1000 random papers from the url vector every 5 seconds\ndata&lt;-articles_info(urls,2,1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA stable internet connection is recommended, specially for web scraping large numbers of papers"
