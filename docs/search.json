Initially, the repository was a collection of scripts to explore MDPI journals. Now, is been transformed into a full R package, with 2 functions to obtain data, 4 plotting functions and several datasets to play with."

    "text": "Data extracting functions\njournal_papers(): This function looks into the target journal sitemap and returns a vector with the URLs of all papers within. Some journals might have more than one sitemap (sitemaps are limited to 50,000 urls), but journal_papers() is able to solve dual sitemaps. To use the function is only necessary to input a string with the code name of the target journal:\n\nurls&lt;-journal_papers(\"agriculture\")\n\nThe journal code name usually coincides with the journal title, but this is not always the case. To find the code name for your journal of interest check the dataset MDPI_journals, included in the package:\n\nMDPI_journals|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n                               name            code\n1                         Acoustics       acoustics\n2                         Actuators       actuators\n3           Administrative Sciences          admsci\n4                       Adolescents     adolescents\n5  Advances in Respiratory Medicine             arm\n6                       Aerobiology     aerobiology\n7                         Aerospace       aerospace\n8                       Agriculture     agriculture\n9                   AgriEngineering agriengineering\n10                    Agrochemicals   agrochemicals\n\n\narticles_info(): Uses the vector produced by journal_papers() to, by web scraping each URL, obtain a data frame with information on editorial times (when article was received and accepted), turnaround times (time differential between acceptance and submission), data on type of issue where the article was published and type of article. The function allows to include a delay between web scraping instances (I recommend using 2 seconds to avoid having much impact in their servers) and, the possibility of only scraping a sample of all URLs\n\n#Will scrape all url values leaving 2 seconds between iterations\ndata&lt;-articles_info(urls,2) \n\n#Will scrape 1000 random papers from the url vector every 5 seconds\ndata&lt;-articles_info(urls,2,1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA stable internet connection is recommended, specially for web scraping large numbers of papers"
